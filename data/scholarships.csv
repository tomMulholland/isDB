Description Nanotechnology Research Network is a project organized by the National Institute of Arts & Sciences and American Nano Society for activating research groups in different universities and connect them through joint projects. An active group is located in Department of Materials Science & Engineering at Jimma University, Ethiopia. The group is chaired by Professor Ali Eftekhari, President of the American Nano Society.. We have a unique strategy in leading the team. Thus, please carefully read the job description before applying. * This is part of a chair system in which assistant/associate professors work under supervision of a chair, and you will be officially appointed as an assistant or associate professor. This is indeed equivalent to the modern postdoc model in the United States and other countries.. * You will work in a team of 15 - 20 postdoc fellows coming from different countries. * Due to the team structure, flexibility to be supervised is one of the main criteria.. * Contrary to many postdoc fellowships, the present position is not focused on a specific research project. Instead, the postdoc fellows are involved in different tasks from research to academic affairs. The main theme is to empower the team members with various academic skills. * The postdoc fellows should necessarily start to work on a new research topic (different from their past experiences), and normally involved in literature review during the first six months. The goal is to publish review article or book.. * The department is quite young, and you are part of the team developing the department. While initiatives have potential opportunities and excellent experiences for academic career, everything is not perfect. * We are looking for people who are ambitious and want to take this step as a jump in his/her academic career (e.g., appointment at top universities). There is no room for people who are interested in routine jobs for today.. * A significant part of this position is teaching duties. * Each member should be committed to the team promotion internationally. Skills for networking are critically important.. * The salary is about $24,000 - $30,000, which is quite high considering the cost of living (i.e. four times higher than local full professors). Housing and flights will be covered. On the other hand, we are looking for those who are interested in the potentials of this position rather than a routine job with high salary. * Jimma city is probably different from your imagination about Africa.

Bring young leaders and activists from the MENA region together, provide a forum for networking and exchange of experiences by fostering mutual dialogue and share visions to manifest tangible changes in their communities. ?

2145,"TUMS FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. Description Introduction:. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is recognized throughout the world, with around 2.5 million affected individuals. Although the disease was recognized in the 19th century, there were limited data on the diagnosis, pathophysiology, and management of MS until the last 50 years. With every step of progress in immunology, imaging and biotechnology, there was indeed progress in our understanding of etiology and diagnosis of this potentially disabling disease. Even with such an amazing progress in technology, the exact etiology and absolute cure for MS is not known yet, thus MS has been the focus of interest in clinical and basic science research in the past decades. Hundreds of MS research groups, centers and clinics are performing research on this field from animal studies to human clinical trials. Due to their interests and efforts, MS has become a partially treatable disease with introduction of the drugs that are able to reduce annual relapse rates and delayed disability. MS management starts with diagnosis and continues with strategies to control relapses, increasing quality of life of the patients, symptomatic treatments and rehabilitation. With our progress in this field, management of different patients has become more complicated and in some cases needs special training. These facts led the pioneer MS research centers around the world to start special MS training programs for neurologists for better management and addressing the ever-growing issues about understanding, diagnosis and treatment of multiple sclerosis. The moderate to high prevalence of MS in Iran (20-50 in 100,000) has led the local neurologist to pay special attention to patient management and research. Tehran University of Medical Sciences, as the leading medical university in Iran provides 18 months of advanced training in diagnosis, treatment and clinical research in Multiple Sclerosis. This Fellowship program is conducted under the supervision of neurologists specialized in MS in Tehran University of Medical sciences and invited authorities from other countries.. Other Criteria Must have background in Neurology. Amount Variable. You must be studying in one of the following countries: Unrestricted. Deadline Variable. You must be from one of the following countries: Unrestricted. Number of Awards 1. You must be studying one of the following: Other. Host Institution Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS). Includes In this 18-month program, fellows would receive comprehensive training in the clinical evaluation and management of the patient with MS and related disorders in both adult and pediatric populations. Fellows will also have the opportunity to participate in a wide variety of original clinical research projects involving all aspects of MS. Fellows are encouraged to design original projects that relate to their interests. There is special focus on Neuroradiology and MRI-based research and training. It is our intent to produce clinically and academically well-trained individuals who will be able to contribute in advancing the state of knowledge of multiple sclerosis and improving the care given to the MS patients. We will take honor in supporting our trainees academically and personally as they begin their careers as MS specialists. Given that most clinical trials in MS have an MRI component as an outcome measure, considerable effort and time of a MS-specialized neurologist is devoted to analysis of the MRI scans of the patients. Intensive individual training is offered in this program by our neuroradiologist and neurologist with special expertise in multiple sclerosis. Our program is designed for those applicants who do not have the license to practice medicine in Iran. It will provide the fellows with the opportunity to fully master their ability to use MRI as a diagnostic tool as well as an outcome measure in the evaluation of therapeutic interventions in MS. In addition, the fellows will participate in research programs and become skilled in the MRI based research, mainly conventional MRI techniques..
