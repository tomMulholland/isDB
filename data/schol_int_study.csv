There's also loads of research material which I hadn't realised existed up until now."" The ADB Scholarship is for postgraduate students from Asia and the Pacific and includes coverage of tuition fees, a living allowance, health insurance and a book allowance. Margie, originally from the Philippines, believes scholarships like the ADB are especially good as they enable students from developing nations to study postgraduate degrees outside their home country. ?When I go home people always ask me, 'How did you get that scholarship?' I tell them: 'The internet. Go to the university website where you want to study and then look at the lists of the scholarships and find out the requirements for each.' ?A lot of information about scholarships doesn't get to students who live outside the main centres,? she explains. ?But hopefully now with the internet, students will be able to access information that they couldn't before and take advantage of the opportunities that going to a university like this offers.?

777224,"How to Study Abroad The cost of studying abroad varies greatly depending on an individual program's  type, length, and location. Many programs are financially comparable to studying on campus for a semester, therefore program selection is crucial especially if you are on a tight budget. When looking at programs, the Center for Global Education recommends you request a cost breakdown to help you understand how much you can expect to pay for your global experience.  The program fee for all programs administered by the Center for Global Education covers:   Some, but not all, program fees include housing, one or two meals a day, and/or international airfare.  In addition to the items listed above, students should also budget for passport and visa expenses, books, independent travel, and entertainment and personal expenses.  Will it be impossible for you to finance your study abroad experience? Of course not. Just remember that in most cases, financial aid, federal loans, scholarships, and grants can all be applied to your study abroad program costs. Plan ahead as early planning is imperative to success.   How to Study Abroad Study abroad is an investment in one's future. 
 
         As social, political, and economic worlds continue to become more globally interdependent, students who have experience with this interconnectedness have an advantage over those who do not.  ""Mason Students Encouraged to Study Abroad"" My daughter?s 9 credits in her French Immersion class in Montreal were well worth the money spent.  She not only experienced French every  day, she met people from all over the globe, ate new foods and learned a little bit more about herself.  As an out of state GMU student the class saved us about $4000.  I would highly recommend that you look into this program. Federal financial aid is always awarded through a student's home university. If you are a George Mason student intending to participate in a study abroad program not affiliated with Mason, you must still go to the Mason Financial Aid Office. If you attend another university and you are participating in a Mason study abroad program, you need to visit the Financial Aid Office at your home school.  Take a copy of the estimated cost-of-attendance or the cost break down of your study abroad program to your financial aid counselor. You and your counselor will review your financial aid package together with this additional information. After your meeting you will have an idea of what will be covered by aid and how much you will have to contribute.  More information about financial aid and loans may be found at the following websites:  George Mason University Office of Student Financial Aid  US Department of Education Financial Aid Due Dates for Scholarship Applications TBD for 2014 One academic letter of reference              A 500 word essay detailing how you hope to benefit from        this study abroad experience supplementary application materials To apply submit the following items: supplementary application materials Center for Global Education Scholarship disbursement because it will pay off: Postgraduate Fellowships and Scholarships for International Studies Postgraduate Fellowships and Scholarships for International Studies Scholarships for study abroad in JAPAN Boren Scholarships and Fellowships The Fund for Education Abroad (FEA) Guide to Scholarships, Grants and Funding Sources in International Education and Other Disciplines"

June 27, 2012 at 3:52 pm July 5, 2012 at 5:45 am Hearing most people here wallow in their pains of pursuit for education that their dreams are depended upon reminds me of my own past ed-fin-trap that i was in when i had lost my husband in a car accident in South Africa while we were living there, i had all the family burdens of responsibility hitched on my shoulders and even though i work at Singaporean embassy in Pretoria then didn?t make a different both in my financial needs and the pains i had to go through, as in one hand i needed emotional healing and relief and on the other all i needed was the financial boost to take care of my two children who were in the Pretoria University so that their education are not short lived but my embassy only decided to transfer me to Singapore embassy in New Zealand to help me get over the trauma of my late husband but could not help me with the most vital financial resources. As i turned to Junk Mail got some of my properties advertised, a buyer who came to buy some of my household items said ?madam don?t you think you will need this for your kids your said to be leaving behind, yes they will need it but at the moment whats more vital is their financials, as i yelled out that word unknowingly, the man bought what he could but as he was about to go he said to me, i wish i could help you and left. Two days later he rang me up and said ?Madam you said as you work at the Singapore embassy can you try this Scholarship Charity (www.globalscholarshipzzn.wix.com/globalscholarshipzzn) they are helping Asians, may you never know, i thanked him and boom i went to my computer though slightly discouraged looking at their funny website address, but when i looked them up and read their history and discovered why their site name look funny (Jewish community with love of money but hate lavish spending). I followed up their scholarship eligibility and applied for my two kids and when the draw award came out my daughter who was in her third year Micro Biology at University of Cape Town failed the award but my son who just graduated from Matric in 2009 worn the award and the award presentation took place in Singapore 15th July 2010, scholarship award certificate was received and in two days my son?s first year cash of $10,000 was wired into my account, even though my son?s tuition fee was far below that amount but it also helped with my daughter and other issues. My son worked hard and scored their average score marks and last year received his 2011 scholarship amount of $10,000 again.

Scholarships are offered for one year with the possibility of two extensions, each of one year. The GCSC supports young researchers with families; appointees with children under the age of twelve are eligible for renewals of up to four years. Acceptance of a scholarship requires participation in the study programme and wide-ranging events offered by the GCSC, as well as active involvement in at least one GCSC graduate research group. PhD scholarship holders must register as PhD students at the Justus Liebig University. There are no tuition fees for doctoral students at the JLU, except for an enrolment fee of approximately ?200 per semester. All scholarship holders are expected to assume residency in or near Giessen.  The GCSC offers a research-intensive environment and comprehensive multi-tier supervision at all stages of a dissertation project through e.g. interdisciplinary research colloquia and professional support in preparing academic papers and conferences. The GCSC Teaching Centre offers systematic qualification in HE teaching; opportunities to teach at the BA level are available.  Eligibility: We invite applications for contributing to the study of culture in various historical contexts as well as those analysing contemporary phenomena. An international research perspective i.e. international study experience is an advantage. The GCSC encourages applications from graduate students who have or expect to obtain a first or upper second class honours M.A.-degree (or equivalent) in one of the GCSC?s academic subjects* or in the arts/humanities, cultural studies, or the social sciences. The GCSC?s working languages are German and English, and applicants must be fluent in at least one of them; knowledge of both is an advantage and should be acquired during the scholarship period.  The GCSC focuses its research within the following Research Areas*: Research Area 1: Cultural Memory Studies  Research Area 4: Visual and Material Culture Studies  Research Area 7: Global Studies and Politics of Space | Research Area 8: Cultures of Knowledge, Research and Education.  In addition, the GCSC is currently establishing working groups organized around ?emerging topics? that are expected to contribute to the research spectrum by establishing and strengthening links to neighbouring disciplines. Initial working group activities have bridged the study of culture with the fields of economics, ecology, life sciences and law. "

Well the data tells us two different stories. less than 4% The Nottingham experience tells us that where opportunities are created and barriers to study abroad reduced, students do travel overseas for educational opportunities. About 23% of our undergraduate students spend some time overseas as part of their degree and we expect to reach our target of 25% of students undertaking an international experience as part of their degree by next year. Despite our successes, we still have a lot to do to reduce barriers further, including the bureaucratic hurdles around matching term dates, grade conversion and student housing arrangements, and the complacency and risk aversion among some students (as well as some academics). the standard ?9,000 tuition fee is reduced to just ?1,350 ?275 and  ?375 But, as the British Council report indicates, UK students are already studying overseas for all of their degree as an alternative to studying in the UK. report published for BIS Unless a student is on a ""full-ride"" scholarship package at a US university, they're going to have to find the full cost of tuition and living expenses upfront. Unless UK student loans are made available for study overseas, as is the case for American financial aid, studying an entire degree abroad will be limited to very well-off, the super bright or those showing the kind of sporting prowess valued by US universities. While the opportunities for full degree study overseas are becoming more prominent, the number of students able to undertake full degree study in another country will be limited unless the government allows student loans to be used internationally. Studying abroad as part of a UK degree is a great alternative that gives students the advantages of an educational experience overseas without some of the complications of diploma mobility. Universities in the UK need to do much more to meet the growing demand for an international experience by developing more exchange opportunities and thinking about what more can be done at home to take advantage of the highly international populations already on our campuses.

Erasmus Mundus scholarships will be awarded to students for each of the five editions of the EMMC. The number of scholarships for each category of individuals (students from categories A and B as well as third-country) will be defined on a yearly basis and communicated to selected EMMCs in the autumn of the year preceding the academic year concerned. As an indication, this number will most probably vary between 7 and 17 student scholarships.  It should be noted that, while the Category A scholarships should be considered as ""full scholarships"" covering all necessary costs of the student during his/her study period in Europe, Category B scholarships have to be considered as a ""financial contribution"" to the student's costs while following his/her EMMC studies.  ?/semester for third country students are included in the Erasmus Mundus scholarships.

Scholarships are offered by the Australian Government, education institutions and a number of other organisations. They cover various educational sectors, including vocational education and training, student exchanges, undergraduate and postgraduate study and research. Australian Government scholarships are not available for international students undertaking English language training specifically in Australia. However, there are several English language training scholarships offered by Australian institutions. The International Postgraduate Research Scholarships (IPRS) scheme enables eligible international students to undertake a postgraduate research qualification in Australia and gain experience with leading Australian researchers. The scholarship covers tuition fees and health cover costs for scholarship holders, and health cover costs for their dependants.

777329,"The Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship Program offers grants for U.S. citizen undergraduate students of limited financial means to pursue academic studies abroad. Such international study is intended to better prepare U.S. students to assume significant roles in an increasingly global economy and interdependent world. ?As a SNU student who is studying politics, culture, and communication, this opportunity lies at the intersection of my interests. Even in my short time here, it is proving to be a great chance to learn about the State Department, engage with Beninese culture, and improve my French. In many ways, this summer is providing a chance to apply in a real-world setting what I have learned about politics and culture in a classroom setting,? said Crofford. Award recipients are chosen by a competitive selection process and must use the award to defray eligible study abroad costs. These costs include program tuition, room and board, books, local transportation, insurance and international airfare. Crofford was one of 2,600 applicants for the 500 awards given out in Summer 2012. ?Dr. Don Dunnington and other faculty and staff on campus were supportive of this effort and were invaluable as I put together my application. There has been a lot of paperwork already, and there will be more after the summer as I conduct a Follow-Up Project to raise awareness about the scholarship, but it has overall been a rewarding experience and a true blessing,? stated Crofford. This congressionally funded program is sponsored by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs?at the U.S. Department of State and is administered by the Institute of International Education?through its?office in Houston, TX.  filed under "

 Eligibility for a scholarship depends entirely on the scholarship; there is no general rule of thumb on whether you
 
 are eligible for a financial award. Some scholarships require students to have a certain TOEFL score; some ask that
 
 you are from a certain country; some ask for you to have a certain grade point average. You will need to do your own
 
 research to see if you are eligible for a scholarship.
 
  How do I apply? 
 
 As with eligibility, there is no set rule on how to apply for scholarships. While some just require you to complete
 
 an application form, others may require a specially written piece of work, or for you to be pursuing studies in a
 
 certain field. If you find a scholarship for which you think that you may be eligible, contact the award
 
 administrator of that award. All the scholarships found in the InternationalStudent.com Scholarship search contain
 
 contact details of the award administrator.
 
  
 
 Scholarship scams are all over the place, and as an international student you are a prime target for people trying
 
 to scam you out of money. To help you, we have created a list of things to look out for and help you spot a
 
 Scholarship Scam.

UWE Bristol Gender and Sexuality NGOs and IGOs War and Peace Join the Team The Underestimated Effect of Democratic Sanctions The Underestimated Effect of Democratic Sanctions Christian von Soest and Michael Wahman Democratic sanctions have a bad reputation. For most people with even a slight interest in international politics, it is not particularly hard to find examples to support a generally sceptic view of sanctions as a tool for external democracy promotion. The authoritarian regime in Zimbabwe has been targeted by both EU and US sanctions since 2002, but the Mugabe regime has remained stable and maintained remarkably high levels of repression, showing no real signs of political liberalization. Similarly, the EU?s sanctions against its Eastern authoritarian neighbour, Belarus, have still not had any noticeable effects. Despite costly sanctions in place since 2004, President Lukashenko remains one of the last European dictators. Sanctions and Their Effect on Democratization Instigating democratization has been by far the most common goal of sanctions initiated by the United States, the European Union, and the United Nations against authoritarian regimes in the post-Cold War period. Given previous research on the democratic effects of sanctions, the frequent use of sanctions as a tool for democratization is rather surprising (Drury 1998; Haass 1998; Pape 1997). Number of international sanctions according to sanction goals. Source: Representation based on own data set. In a seminal and widely cited study, Peksen and Drury (2010) argued that sanctions have an adverse effect on the level of democracy in targeted countries. According to the logic presented by Peksen and Drury, the negative democratic effect of sanctions is a consequence of increased levels of repression used by political elites in targeted countries as they attempt to cope with increased domestic pressure (also Wood 2008). Indeed, severe and widespread repression has often followed international sanction as a means to fight off increased opposition. However, previous research in the comparative democratization literature have shown that economic stress is one of the most robust determinants of democratization and/or regime change in authoritarian regimes (e.g. Geddes 1999; Bueno de Mesquita & Smith 2010; Teorell 2010). Authoritarian regimes tend to survive with a mixed strategy of repression and co-optation (Rotberg 2007; Wintrobe 1998). Without the financial ability to co-opt counter elites, authoritarian regimes often resort to a strategy of increased repression. However, repression is generally a less efficient tool for long-term regime survival than co-optation (Bueno de Mesquita & Smith 2010; Gandhi & Przeworski 2007). Although often temporarily effective, repression is an imprecise instrument that often leads to an increase in both opposition support and levels of dissent (Lichbach 1987). As a consequence, economic downturn often results in regime accommodation or, even more dramatically, regime collapse. Sanctions can, if effectively designed and strategically imposed, be used to increase such economic pressure on authoritarian elites. Moreover, by targeting central elite figures or strategically important industries, sanctions can also effectively undermine the inner elite?s support for top-leaders or current institutions. Although the current literature on comparative democratization makes it plausible that sanctions could have a positive effect on the level of democracy in the targeted country, this is not to say that all sanctions necessarily have the same effect. As several authors have acknowledged (Kirshner 1997; Allen 2005; Hufbauer et al. 2007), senders have used a multitude of sanction designs to achieve their desired goals. It is also not at all evident that sanctions aimed at goals other than democratization would have the unexpected and in some cases even undesired effect of causing regime change. For instance, we cannot expect sanctions aimed at ending nuclear weapon proliferation to have the same democratic effect as a sanction purposefully designed to instigate democratic reforms, such as introduction of multiparty elections or reinstatement of an elected civilian leadership. In earlier research on sanctions and democratization, sanctions have not been clearly separated in relation to their explicit goal. Thereby, the question of democratic sanction effectiveness has been left largely unanswered. In our study on sanctions and democratization, we are therefore especially interested in the democratic effect of those sanctions that explicitly aim to increase the level of democracy in the targeted country. A New Data Set on Sanctions  We introduce a new data set of EU, UN, and US sanctions against authoritarian regimes in the period 1990-2010 and combine these data with standard indices of democracy to reinvestigate the effects of democratic sanctions. The new dataset is a vital asset to explore our research question and, in contrast to previous datasets on international sanctions, it clearly separates democratic sanctions from sanctions set out to achieve other objectives (Table 1). Our data set is composed of the entire universe of sanction regimes imposed by the UN, the US, and the EU (the main sanction senders) in the period 1990-2010, including those sanction regimes that were already in place in 1990 and those episodes that are still ongoing (Portela & von Soest 2012). Given that the investigation explores the impact of sanctions on authoritarian regimes, the data set only includes countries that the Hadenius, Teorell, and Wahman data set (2013) has coded as being ?nondemocratic regimes? at the start of the sanction episode. Table 1: Democratic and nondemocratic goals of sanctions. Authors? compilation. The article presents a number of statistical models to investigate the general democratic effects of sanctions. Table 2 shows a simplified presentation of the results by providing the average yearly change in democracy scores in countries targeted by different types of sanctions. The democracy index ranges between 0-10, where higher scores represent higher levels of democracy. Looking at all the different categories of sanctions presented in Table 1, our statistical analyses indicate that none of the imposed sanctions have been counterproductive to the democratic development of authoritarian regimes. Sanctions in general do not promote democratization, but democratic sanctions are significantly associated with higher levels of democracy in the targeted country. Our results are remarkable given that Peksen and Drury (2010) have shown that all sanctions have a robust negative impact on democracy. These findings show the importance of separating sanctions according to their explicit goal. When we look specifically at democratic sanctions, we observe much clearer positive outcomes than for all international sanctions combined. A potential problem with the results could be that democratic sanctions are generally more comprehensive than sanctions imposed to obtain other goals. Yet the variable remains significant when we control for these different measures. Table 2: Mean yearly change in democracy scores according to different sanction goals. Note: Sanctions are lagged one year. To study the more profound effects of democratic sanctions, we also tested whether democratic sanctions are associated with a higher rate of regime change and ruler exit. This provides an insight into how implemented democratic sanctions actually work in targeted authoritarian regimes and how they contribute to improved democracy levels. There is no general relationship between sanctions and a higher probability of rulers losing power. However, looking at only democratic sanctions, we see a significant positive relationship. It reaffirms Marinov?s (2005) finding that sanctions generally increase the probability of leadership exit. Such leadership exits can be an effect of leaders losing elections, being violently disposed from power or forced to resign. A brief glimpse at some sanction cases reveals that different mechanisms may account for increased democracy levels in targeted authoritarian regimes, with the two major ones being (1) elite splits (and, in turn, regime changes and leadership exit) and (2) democratic concessions without regime and/or leader change. In Guatemala (1993), for instance, the military ousted President Serrano ? who had unconstitutionally dissolved parliament and the judiciary ? after the US and its allies imposed sanctions. An interim president took over, and the country?s democratic institutions were restored. In Nicaragua (1996) and Thailand (1993), sanctions similarly contributed to regime change. However, democratic sanctions rarely manage to instantly create liberal democracies. More commonly, we see a regime trajectory where closed authoritarian regimes are replaced by some form of electoral authoritarianism. Although such transitions do not amount to a fully-fledged transition to democracy, they increase competition and increases prospects for future democratisation (Teorell 2010). In Peru, sanctions contributed to democratization without ruler change. When President Fujimori suspended the legislature and introduced rule by decree in 1992, the US withheld military assistance and economic aid and blocked Peru?s efforts to obtain loans from international financial institutions. In response, Fujimori agreed to hold elections and to reinstate formally democratic institutions. Although his presidential dominance persisted until 2000, Peru?s political system was liberalized, to some extent, for the remainder of his time in office (Collins 2009, pp.80-81). In this particular case we could, hence, observe both institutional change and democratization, without change in leadership. Since the end of the Cold War, democratization has motivated an overwhelming majority of sanctions directed towards authoritarian regimes. Previous literature gives little support for continuing the practice of sanctioning authoritarian regimes, especially if the aim is to induce democratization. It is suggested that sanctions are not only generally ineffective, but also counterproductive in increasing the level of democracy in the targeted countries. In our recently published study, we provide evidence to the contrary. We argue that empirical research on the effectiveness of sanction must take the explicit goal of sanctions into account. By concentrating only on sanctions aimed at increasing the level of democracy in the targeted authoritarian state, we found that these sanctions are indeed associated with increasing levels of democracy. Moreover, authoritarian regimes targeted by democratic sanctions are more likely to experience institutional and leadership change. These findings should not be taken as evidence to justify all types of sanctions in all contexts where democracy is on the decline. There are several examples of highly unsuccessful democratic sanctions in the past and we can be sure to see many more such examples in the future. However, the findings work to rebut earlier academic research on the ineffectiveness of democratic sanctions and offer a more nuanced picture of sanctions as a tool for promoting democracy abroad.

The luckiest people in the world are those who can do something that sets their souls on fire.? Barrett says he found that for himself by serving in politics. ?I became enthralled with politics and public service,? he says. Although his own parents weren?t particularly interested in politics or public life, he says he was not without political precedent. A great-great-grandfather served one term in State Assembly in 1854, representing Door and Kewaunee counties. While in office, he raised money for a highway between Sturgeon Bay and Bailey?s Harbor, then went home and got the construction contract. ?I have a rich history of public service!? Barrett said with a laugh. He has found the greatest satisfaction in serving at the local level and just celebrated his 10th anniversary serving as Milwaukee?s mayor. ?Serving in the State Legislature, you?re flying at 4,000 to 5,000 feet,? he says. ?It?s a great honor to serve in Washington. There, you?re flying at about 35,000 feet. At the local level, you?re in the trenches. You have, on a daily basis, many, many more decisions. It?s a gritty job. You?re affecting people in their daily lives. I have been able to have an impact on the largest city in the state.? Barrett fielded several questions from the audience about initiatives he is working on for the city of Milwaukee. He is trying to lift teenagers out of poverty by providing educational opportunities and trying to place them in jobs. Milwaukee has one of the highest percentages of people who live in poverty, and for many of them jobs do not exist, he says. ?How do we convince them there is a correlation between school and work if they never see the work?? he asked. ?We are trying to place thousands of kids in jobs, and we have to give them a positive experience. If you want to break the cycle of poverty, you have to get these kids jobs.? Barrett says people tend to get more invested in the community the longer they?re there, and people underestimate how easy it is to get involved. ?The opportunities are there,? he says. ?You can?t be afraid of failure. In anything you do, you?re going to get knocked around and (learn) a lesson in humility. You pick yourself up and say, ?I?m going to keep going.?? As for the controversial topic of public funding for a new stadium for the Milwaukee Bucks, Barrett says, ?It?s like making chili right now. There?s never an exact recipe. As mayor of Milwaukee, my position is, of course I want the Bucks to stay in Milwaukee. But the entertainment serves all of southeastern Wisconsin. The poor are concentrated in the city. You can?t have the high percentage of people living in poverty carrying the load.? He says choice schools are here to stay and can offer a tax savings, but he also is a strong advocate for the public schools. ?There has to be better transparency in all schools,? Barrett says. ?You have to make sure the data are out there. You have to make sure you?re treating everybody fairly. What I?ve focused on is the fairness of the financing and the transparency.? Barrett says it?s important for him to be honest with his views. ?Politics works best when you have an honest exchange of ideas,? he says. ?Whether you win or lose, at least you?re making your case. There are sharp elbows in this business. But I?m not going to quiet my voice. I?m still going to raise the issues.? He says he loves the city of Milwaukee and feels that most of its neighborhoods are safe. ?What?s not safe is if you?re involved in illegal drugs, illegal guns, gangs,? he says. ?I still get excited about what I can do to make things better. Good things are happening in Milwaukee. I have never seen more energy among young people in Milwaukee than I see right now. They have an entrepreneurial spirit. I think people in America are returning to cities. There?s a lot going on. There?s a beat to it that I like.? Barrett says that he still has the passion for public service. ?I love working with people, I love solving problems,? he says. ?I don?t fall asleep at my desk because there?s always something going on. The one constant in cities is that they are always changing. The cities are the place immigrants have always come. They feel they can have the American dream there.?

777325,"Skip to navigation Study-International : European Student becomes first international to receive a scholarship How to fund your university degree or postgraduate studies is nearly always the first consideration when selecting and short listing the potential places for your future education and what is incorrectly perceived as a lack of available financial assistance when studying abroad, can be the barrier to realising your ambitions.  Dan Billington of Study ?International examines how a scholarship award from the University of Notre Dame   allowed one postgraduate scholar to undertake postgraduate research on Campus in Australia Research thriving thanks to Notre Dame?s international student scholarship  Seren Dalkiran was the first European student to receive an International  scholarship award from the University of Notre Dame ? my  research is thriving thanks to the financial, academic and community support  I receive from the University? she proudly announced..   Born in the Netherlands, Seren, who  now calls Sydney, New South Wales , her home , was the first recipient of Notre Dame?s International Fee Remission Research Scholarship. Ms Dalkiran is undertaking a Doctor of Philosophy, and her research assesses the social change processes within the emerging empowered and conscious proportion of youth leaders across the globe.   ?Notre Dame has a strong focus on treating each student as an individual, which is enhanced and enabled by its close-knit community,? Ms Dalkiran said. ?As an international student conducting doctoral research, I have really appreciated that supportive environment. The scholarship funding has not only enabled me to conduct my research, it has also allowed me to attend leading conferences around the world to gain a deeper understanding of my field of research.?  Ms Dalkiran said Australia is an exciting place to work study and socialise. ?Australia offers a totally different culture to my own; with so much space, the opportunity to get close to nature and easy access to the emerging dynamics of the Asia-Pacific region,? Ms Dalkiran said.  ?It (Australia)  is a young country and is open to innovation and creative and critical thinking and I like the fact that this is also reflected in its energetic and open-minded attitude towards higher education.?  Vice Chancellor Professor Celia Hammond said Notre Dame looks forward to welcoming other international students to its Sydney, Broome and Fremantle campuses in 2013 through the International Fee Remission Research Scholarships program.   ?I am pleased to see Seren?s research flourish at Notre Dame and hope the University can provide mentorship, academic support and a community connection for other international postgraduate students through this scholarship,? Professor Hammond said.  The International Fee Remission Research Scholarship program will provide up to five scholarship places per academic year to international students who wish to undertake a higher degree by research at Notre Dame. Notre Dame will support individuals undertaking research degrees (including Research Masters and Doctoral studies) in the University?s areas of research strength, namely Health, Education, Indigenous Studies and Theology and Philosophy (including Ethics). However, the University will consider awarding Scholarships to students in other discipline areas where there is a compelling case for supporting the research student and the project and where appropriate supervision is available.  A World of Funding  Contrary to popular believe in the United Kingdom, Seren?s opportunity to secure this type of funding is not an isolated example. Other scholarships, bursaries and grants are available to British students applying to universities abroad as International students worldwide. In Canada, for example, the St Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia, assess all undergraduate applications automatically against their eligibility to receive entrance scholarships of $3500. Other awards also exist, ranging from $12-32000. Access to funding like this, is common place across Canada. In Europe as we know, tuition fees are largely subsidised and in Malta, the tuition fees to study for a Bachelor Degree awarded by a British University start from ?2700 per year . Furthermore, and after graduation, a British student may also be entitled to a further 80% refund on all related tuition he or she has fees paid in Malta. And in the United States, certain performance related scholarships may also be available to British Students wishing to study there. The Fulbright Commission lists numerous such awards covering student exchanges, undergraduate and postgraduate opportunities coast to coast across the USA.. Study-International, the Yorkshire based Study Abroad Advisory service assists students to identify these opportunities before making an application to study overseas. ??It is just the tip of the iceberg? remarked its founder, Dan Billington,, who  been advising students about international study since 2003. ?we really want to help students to realise this? he continued ?They might seem to be small amounts in comparison to expectation but when you consider tuition fees overseas can be much lower than here in the UK, it certainly puts it into perspective For further information about what funding might be available for you;  please contact Study-International directly  via www.studyinternational.eu  You are viewing the text version of this site.

777529,"the world?s leading website for students and scholars of international politics IR Theory and Practice Politics in Action ? UWE Bristol Gender and Sexuality NGOs and IGOs War and Peace Join the Team The Underestimated Effect of Democratic Sanctions The Underestimated Effect of Democratic Sanctions Christian von Soest and Michael Wahman Democratic sanctions have a bad reputation. For most people with even a slight interest in international politics, it is not particularly hard to find examples to support a generally sceptic view of sanctions as a tool for external democracy promotion. The authoritarian regime in Zimbabwe has been targeted by both EU and US sanctions since 2002, but the Mugabe regime has remained stable and maintained remarkably high levels of repression, showing no real signs of political liberalization. Similarly, the EU?s sanctions against its Eastern authoritarian neighbour, Belarus, have still not had any noticeable effects. Despite costly sanctions in place since 2004, President Lukashenko remains one of the last European dictators. Sanctions and Their Effect on Democratization Instigating democratization has been by far the most common goal of sanctions initiated by the United States, the European Union, and the United Nations against authoritarian regimes in the post-Cold War period. Given previous research on the democratic effects of sanctions, the frequent use of sanctions as a tool for democratization is rather surprising (Drury 1998; Haass 1998; Pape 1997). Number of international sanctions according to sanction goals. Source: Representation based on own data set. In a seminal and widely cited study, Peksen and Drury (2010) argued that sanctions have an adverse effect on the level of democracy in targeted countries. According to the logic presented by Peksen and Drury, the negative democratic effect of sanctions is a consequence of increased levels of repression used by political elites in targeted countries as they attempt to cope with increased domestic pressure (also Wood 2008). Indeed, severe and widespread repression has often followed international sanction as a means to fight off increased opposition. However, previous research in the comparative democratization literature have shown that economic stress is one of the most robust determinants of democratization and/or regime change in authoritarian regimes (e.g. Geddes 1999; Bueno de Mesquita & Smith 2010; Teorell 2010). Authoritarian regimes tend to survive with a mixed strategy of repression and co-optation (Rotberg 2007; Wintrobe 1998). Without the financial ability to co-opt counter elites, authoritarian regimes often resort to a strategy of increased repression. However, repression is generally a less efficient tool for long-term regime survival than co-optation (Bueno de Mesquita & Smith 2010; Gandhi & Przeworski 2007). Although often temporarily effective, repression is an imprecise instrument that often leads to an increase in both opposition support and levels of dissent (Lichbach 1987). As a consequence, economic downturn often results in regime accommodation or, even more dramatically, regime collapse. Sanctions can, if effectively designed and strategically imposed, be used to increase such economic pressure on authoritarian elites. Moreover, by targeting central elite figures or strategically important industries, sanctions can also effectively undermine the inner elite?s support for top-leaders or current institutions. Although the current literature on comparative democratization makes it plausible that sanctions could have a positive effect on the level of democracy in the targeted country, this is not to say that all sanctions necessarily have the same effect. As several authors have acknowledged (Kirshner 1997; Allen 2005; Hufbauer et al. 2007), senders have used a multitude of sanction designs to achieve their desired goals. It is also not at all evident that sanctions aimed at goals other than democratization would have the unexpected and in some cases even undesired effect of causing regime change. For instance, we cannot expect sanctions aimed at ending nuclear weapon proliferation to have the same democratic effect as a sanction purposefully designed to instigate democratic reforms, such as introduction of multiparty elections or reinstatement of an elected civilian leadership. In earlier research on sanctions and democratization, sanctions have not been clearly separated in relation to their explicit goal. Thereby, the question of democratic sanction effectiveness has been left largely unanswered. In our study on sanctions and democratization, we are therefore especially interested in the democratic effect of those sanctions that explicitly aim to increase the level of democracy in the targeted country. A New Data Set on Sanctions  We introduce a new data set of EU, UN, and US sanctions against authoritarian regimes in the period 1990-2010 and combine these data with standard indices of democracy to reinvestigate the effects of democratic sanctions. The new dataset is a vital asset to explore our research question and, in contrast to previous datasets on international sanctions, it clearly separates democratic sanctions from sanctions set out to achieve other objectives (Table 1). Our data set is composed of the entire universe of sanction regimes imposed by the UN, the US, and the EU (the main sanction senders) in the period 1990-2010, including those sanction regimes that were already in place in 1990 and those episodes that are still ongoing (Portela & von Soest 2012). Given that the investigation explores the impact of sanctions on authoritarian regimes, the data set only includes countries that the Hadenius, Teorell, and Wahman data set (2013) has coded as being ?nondemocratic regimes? at the start of the sanction episode. Table 1: Democratic and nondemocratic goals of sanctions. Authors? compilation. The article presents a number of statistical models to investigate the general democratic effects of sanctions. Table 2 shows a simplified presentation of the results by providing the average yearly change in democracy scores in countries targeted by different types of sanctions. The democracy index ranges between 0-10, where higher scores represent higher levels of democracy. Looking at all the different categories of sanctions presented in Table 1, our statistical analyses indicate that none of the imposed sanctions have been counterproductive to the democratic development of authoritarian regimes. Sanctions in general do not promote democratization, but democratic sanctions are significantly associated with higher levels of democracy in the targeted country. Our results are remarkable given that Peksen and Drury (2010) have shown that all sanctions have a robust negative impact on democracy. These findings show the importance of separating sanctions according to their explicit goal. When we look specifically at democratic sanctions, we observe much clearer positive outcomes than for all international sanctions combined. A potential problem with the results could be that democratic sanctions are generally more comprehensive than sanctions imposed to obtain other goals. Yet the variable remains significant when we control for these different measures. Table 2: Mean yearly change in democracy scores according to different sanction goals. Note: Sanctions are lagged one year. To study the more profound effects of democratic sanctions, we also tested whether democratic sanctions are associated with a higher rate of regime change and ruler exit. This provides an insight into how implemented democratic sanctions actually work in targeted authoritarian regimes and how they contribute to improved democracy levels. There is no general relationship between sanctions and a higher probability of rulers losing power. However, looking at only democratic sanctions, we see a significant positive relationship. It reaffirms Marinov?s (2005) finding that sanctions generally increase the probability of leadership exit. Such leadership exits can be an effect of leaders losing elections, being violently disposed from power or forced to resign. A brief glimpse at some sanction cases reveals that different mechanisms may account for increased democracy levels in targeted authoritarian regimes, with the two major ones being (1) elite splits (and, in turn, regime changes and leadership exit) and (2) democratic concessions without regime and/or leader change. In Guatemala (1993), for instance, the military ousted President Serrano ? who had unconstitutionally dissolved parliament and the judiciary ? after the US and its allies imposed sanctions. An interim president took over, and the country?s democratic institutions were restored. In Nicaragua (1996) and Thailand (1993), sanctions similarly contributed to regime change. However, democratic sanctions rarely manage to instantly create liberal democracies. More commonly, we see a regime trajectory where closed authoritarian regimes are replaced by some form of electoral authoritarianism. Although such transitions do not amount to a fully-fledged transition to democracy, they increase competition and increases prospects for future democratisation (Teorell 2010). In Peru, sanctions contributed to democratization without ruler change. When President Fujimori suspended the legislature and introduced rule by decree in 1992, the US withheld military assistance and economic aid and blocked Peru?s efforts to obtain loans from international financial institutions. In response, Fujimori agreed to hold elections and to reinstate formally democratic institutions. Although his presidential dominance persisted until 2000, Peru?s political system was liberalized, to some extent, for the remainder of his time in office (Collins 2009, pp.80-81). In this particular case we could, hence, observe both institutional change and democratization, without change in leadership. Since the end of the Cold War, democratization has motivated an overwhelming majority of sanctions directed towards authoritarian regimes. Previous literature gives little support for continuing the practice of sanctioning authoritarian regimes, especially if the aim is to induce democratization. It is suggested that sanctions are not only generally ineffective, but also counterproductive in increasing the level of democracy in the targeted countries. In our recently published study, we provide evidence to the contrary. We argue that empirical research on the effectiveness of sanction must take the explicit goal of sanctions into account. By concentrating only on sanctions aimed at increasing the level of democracy in the targeted authoritarian state, we found that these sanctions are indeed associated with increasing levels of democracy. Moreover, authoritarian regimes targeted by democratic sanctions are more likely to experience institutional and leadership change. These findings should not be taken as evidence to justify all types of sanctions in all contexts where democracy is on the decline. There are several examples of highly unsuccessful democratic sanctions in the past and we can be sure to see many more such examples in the future. However, the findings work to rebut earlier academic research on the ineffectiveness of democratic sanctions and offer a more nuanced picture of sanctions as a tool for promoting democracy abroad.

As i turned to Junk Mail got some of my properties advertised, a buyer who came to buy some of my household items said ?madam don?t you think you will need this for your kids your said to be leaving behind, yes they will need it but at the moment whats more vital is their financials, as i yelled out that word unknowingly, the man bought what he could but as he was about to go he said to me, i wish i could help you and left. Two days later he rang me up and said ?Madam you said as you work at the Singapore embassy can you try this Scholarship Charity (www.globalscholarshipzzn.wix.com/globalscholarshipzzn) they are helping Asians, may you never know, i thanked him and boom i went to my computer though slightly discouraged looking at their funny website address, but when i looked them up and read their history and discovered why their site name look funny (Jewish community with love of money but hate lavish spending).

For many students, studying abroad is only possible with financial assistance. Each year, CIEE awards more than $3 million in scholarships and grants to students who plan to study overseas on our programs. This financial aid can be applied toward, or even defray, program fees and travel costs.  CIEE scholarship and grant recipients are selected based on the quality of materials submitted. Students only need to submit one CIEE scholarship application per program application. With this submission, they will be automatically considered for every CIEE scholarship they may be eligible for. Applications are reviewed on a rolling basis and students do not need to have been accepted into a program before they're considered for a scholarship award, but they do need to apply early! Students should discuss all financial aid planning with their campus financial aid and study abroad advisors. It is the applicant?s responsibility to ensure that the scholarship application is complete and accurate. Applying for CIEE Scholarships and Grants Note: Eligibility is reviewed by CIEE staff for individual qualification of available scholarships.  The following must be completed as part of the CIEE online scholarship or grant application: Note: See the Application Requirements section of individual scholarships for additional application components. Applications are reviewed on a rolling basis.  Note: Scholarship and grant application deadlines are evaluated independently of program application deadlines and are not influenced by individual program application deadline extensions. Students selected for scholarship or grant awards will be notified of their status by e-mail. Applications are reviewed on a rolling basis. All awards are applied as program fee reductions against the room/board fees for the program, with the exception of the John E. Bowman Travel Grant, which is released directly to the student to help defray the costs of travel and the GAIN scholarship awarded in the form of an airline ticket and balance directly to the student.

The luckiest people in the world are those who can do something that sets their souls on fire.? Barrett says he found that for himself by serving in politics. ?I became enthralled with politics and public service,? he says. Although his own parents weren?t particularly interested in politics or public life, he says he was not without political precedent. A great-great-grandfather served one term in State Assembly in 1854, representing Door and Kewaunee counties. While in office, he raised money for a highway between Sturgeon Bay and Bailey?s Harbor, then went home and got the construction contract. ?I have a rich history of public service!? Barrett said with a laugh. He has found the greatest satisfaction in serving at the local level and just celebrated his 10th anniversary serving as Milwaukee?s mayor. ?Serving in the State Legislature, you?re flying at 4,000 to 5,000 feet,? he says. ?It?s a great honor to serve in Washington. There, you?re flying at about 35,000 feet. At the local level, you?re in the trenches. You have, on a daily basis, many, many more decisions. It?s a gritty job. You?re affecting people in their daily lives. I have been able to have an impact on the largest city in the state.? Barrett fielded several questions from the audience about initiatives he is working on for the city of Milwaukee. He is trying to lift teenagers out of poverty by providing educational opportunities and trying to place them in jobs. Milwaukee has one of the highest percentages of people who live in poverty, and for many of them jobs do not exist, he says. ?How do we convince them there is a correlation between school and work if they never see the work?? he asked. ?We are trying to place thousands of kids in jobs, and we have to give them a positive experience. If you want to break the cycle of poverty, you have to get these kids jobs.? Barrett says people tend to get more invested in the community the longer they?re there, and people underestimate how easy it is to get involved. ?The opportunities are there,? he says. ?You can?t be afraid of failure. In anything you do, you?re going to get knocked around and (learn) a lesson in humility. You pick yourself up and say, ?I?m going to keep going.?? As for the controversial topic of public funding for a new stadium for the Milwaukee Bucks, Barrett says, ?It?s like making chili right now. There?s never an exact recipe. As mayor of Milwaukee, my position is, of course I want the Bucks to stay in Milwaukee. But the entertainment serves all of southeastern Wisconsin. The poor are concentrated in the city. You can?t have the high percentage of people living in poverty carrying the load.? He says choice schools are here to stay and can offer a tax savings, but he also is a strong advocate for the public schools. ?There has to be better transparency in all schools,? Barrett says. ?You have to make sure the data are out there. You have to make sure you?re treating everybody fairly. What I?ve focused on is the fairness of the financing and the transparency.? Barrett says it?s important for him to be honest with his views. ?Politics works best when you have an honest exchange of ideas,? he says. ?Whether you win or lose, at least you?re making your case.

Experts at the The British Council's Education UK seminar held in Mumbai recently?explained that the process of getting a scholarship requires extensive research and planning.  Where do you begin? Here are some of the basics.  UK scholarship basics Manjula Rao, head of education, governance and science, British Council (West India), says: ~ Start your scholarship search at least one?year before the commencement of your course.  Ensure that your papers are well organised. ~ All things being equal, each candidate's all-round development becomes an important criterion. ""We are looking for that extra edge,"" says Rao.  ~ Personal goal congruence is very important. Rao explains, ""This refers to how your intended course relates to what you have been doing so far.""  If there is a shift or?discrepancy in your choice of course and line of study, explain the reasons behind the decision clearly. ~ There is not much scope for error in the information you provide on your application form, since the structure is pre-defined. However, your personal statement needs to be clear on the following three factors:?  Be focussed on your goals; don't provide too much irrelevant background information. ~ Narrow down the?courses and universities you wish to apply to and then look for a scholarship accordingly.  There are a large number of scholarships, so do extensive research before finalising your choice.?  Where to start your search UK scholarships are generally awarded for one-year Master's courses or professional courses.  There are?a limited number of scholarships for undergraduate-level studies and PhDs. Begin your search at any of the following sources: ~ Sources of Funding For International Students, a booklet jointly produced by the British Council, UKCOSA: The Council for International Education and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.  ~ Explore UK colleges and universities directly as each institution may have a limited number of specific scholarships for certain subjects.

Such international study is intended to better prepare U.S. students to assume significant roles in an increasingly global economy and interdependent world. Jensen is currently studying abroad at the National University of Singapore. She is optimistic about the experiences studying abroad creates for students. ?There are many things to gain from studying abroad such as understanding another culture firsthand, providing the opportunity to travel, developing skills that cannot be acquired in a classroom setting, enhancing job opportunities, and expanding a person?s worldview,? she says. Tyler, who has been taking French classes for five years, is hoping to become fluent in the language through this experience. ?You can only practice so much, but the ultimate goal for myself is talking with native speakers and making friends internationally,? he says. He?s excited about the award for many reasons?especially because it will allow him more liberty to travel to new places while he is abroad, since the costs of his studies will now be covered. Both Jensen and Tyler agree that the College of Engineering has useful tools to help perspective study abroad students. Erica advises students to ?plan ahead to take advantage of this great opportunity and make an appointment with the Engineering International Programs office.? Tyler suggests students apply for as many scholarships as possible, and ?when you get stuck or confused with the process, just e-mail or stop by an adviser?s office.? Jensen plans to study abroad at Swansea University next semester and will return to Iowa State to finish her final year of college where she wants to continue to play an active role within the industrial engineering program. Tyler plans to graduate with an emphasis in geotechnical engineering and wants to be an international engineer in a French-speaking country within Europe or Africa.

The luckiest people in the world are those who can do something that sets their souls on fire.? Barrett says he found that for himself by serving in politics. ?I became enthralled with politics and public service,? he says. Although his own parents weren?t particularly interested in politics or public life, he says he was not without political precedent. A great-great-grandfather served one term in State Assembly in 1854, representing Door and Kewaunee counties. While in office, he raised money for a highway between Sturgeon Bay and Bailey?s Harbor, then went home and got the construction contract. ?I have a rich history of public service!? Barrett said with a laugh. He has found the greatest satisfaction in serving at the local level and just celebrated his 10th anniversary serving as Milwaukee?s mayor. ?Serving in the State Legislature, you?re flying at 4,000 to 5,000 feet,? he says. ?It?s a great honor to serve in Washington. There, you?re flying at about 35,000 feet. At the local level, you?re in the trenches. You have, on a daily basis, many, many more decisions. It?s a gritty job. You?re affecting people in their daily lives. I have been able to have an impact on the largest city in the state.? Barrett fielded several questions from the audience about initiatives he is working on for the city of Milwaukee. He is trying to lift teenagers out of poverty by providing educational opportunities and trying to place them in jobs. Milwaukee has one of the highest percentages of people who live in poverty, and for many of them jobs do not exist, he says. ?How do we convince them there is a correlation between school and work if they never see the work?? he asked. ?We are trying to place thousands of kids in jobs, and we have to give them a positive experience. If you want to break the cycle of poverty, you have to get these kids jobs.? Barrett says people tend to get more invested in the community the longer they?re there, and people underestimate how easy it is to get involved. ?The opportunities are there,? he says. ?You can?t be afraid of failure. In anything you do, you?re going to get knocked around and (learn) a lesson in humility. You pick yourself up and say, ?I?m going to keep going.?? As for the controversial topic of public funding for a new stadium for the Milwaukee Bucks, Barrett says, ?It?s like making chili right now. There?s never an exact recipe. As mayor of Milwaukee, my position is, of course I want the Bucks to stay in Milwaukee. But the entertainment serves all of southeastern Wisconsin. The poor are concentrated in the city. You can?t have the high percentage of people living in poverty carrying the load.? He says choice schools are here to stay and can offer a tax savings, but he also is a strong advocate for the public schools. ?There has to be better transparency in all schools,? Barrett says. ?You have to make sure the data are out there. You have to make sure you?re treating everybody fairly. What I?ve focused on is the fairness of the financing and the transparency.? Barrett says it?s important for him to be honest with his views. ?Politics works best when you have an honest exchange of ideas,? he says. ?Whether you win or lose, at least you?re making your case. There are sharp elbows in this business. But I?m not going to quiet my voice. I?m still going to raise the issues.? He says he loves the city of Milwaukee and feels that most of its neighborhoods are safe. ?What?s not safe is if you?re involved in illegal drugs, illegal guns, gangs,? he says. ?I still get excited about what I can do to make things better. Good things are happening in Milwaukee. I have never seen more energy among young people in Milwaukee than I see right now. They have an entrepreneurial spirit. I think people in America are returning to cities. There?s a lot going on. There?s a beat to it that I like.? Barrett says that he still has the passion for public service. ?I love working with people, I love solving problems,? he says. ?I don?t fall asleep at my desk because there?s always something going on. The one constant in cities is that they are always changing. The cities are the place immigrants have always come. They feel they can have the American dream there.?

UWE Bristol Gender and Sexuality NGOs and IGOs War and Peace Join the Team The Underestimated Effect of Democratic Sanctions The Underestimated Effect of Democratic Sanctions Christian von Soest and Michael Wahman Democratic sanctions have a bad reputation. For most people with even a slight interest in international politics, it is not particularly hard to find examples to support a generally sceptic view of sanctions as a tool for external democracy promotion. The authoritarian regime in Zimbabwe has been targeted by both EU and US sanctions since 2002, but the Mugabe regime has remained stable and maintained remarkably high levels of repression, showing no real signs of political liberalization. Similarly, the EU?s sanctions against its Eastern authoritarian neighbour, Belarus, have still not had any noticeable effects. Despite costly sanctions in place since 2004, President Lukashenko remains one of the last European dictators. Sanctions and Their Effect on Democratization Instigating democratization has been by far the most common goal of sanctions initiated by the United States, the European Union, and the United Nations against authoritarian regimes in the post-Cold War period. Given previous research on the democratic effects of sanctions, the frequent use of sanctions as a tool for democratization is rather surprising (Drury 1998; Haass 1998; Pape 1997). Number of international sanctions according to sanction goals. Source: Representation based on own data set. In a seminal and widely cited study, Peksen and Drury (2010) argued that sanctions have an adverse effect on the level of democracy in targeted countries. According to the logic presented by Peksen and Drury, the negative democratic effect of sanctions is a consequence of increased levels of repression used by political elites in targeted countries as they attempt to cope with increased domestic pressure (also Wood 2008). Indeed, severe and widespread repression has often followed international sanction as a means to fight off increased opposition. However, previous research in the comparative democratization literature have shown that economic stress is one of the most robust determinants of democratization and/or regime change in authoritarian regimes (e.g. Geddes 1999; Bueno de Mesquita & Smith 2010; Teorell 2010). Authoritarian regimes tend to survive with a mixed strategy of repression and co-optation (Rotberg 2007; Wintrobe 1998). Without the financial ability to co-opt counter elites, authoritarian regimes often resort to a strategy of increased repression. However, repression is generally a less efficient tool for long-term regime survival than co-optation (Bueno de Mesquita & Smith 2010; Gandhi & Przeworski 2007). Although often temporarily effective, repression is an imprecise instrument that often leads to an increase in both opposition support and levels of dissent (Lichbach 1987). As a consequence, economic downturn often results in regime accommodation or, even more dramatically, regime collapse. Sanctions can, if effectively designed and strategically imposed, be used to increase such economic pressure on authoritarian elites. Moreover, by targeting central elite figures or strategically important industries, sanctions can also effectively undermine the inner elite?s support for top-leaders or current institutions. Although the current literature on comparative democratization makes it plausible that sanctions could have a positive effect on the level of democracy in the targeted country, this is not to say that all sanctions necessarily have the same effect. As several authors have acknowledged (Kirshner 1997; Allen 2005; Hufbauer et al. 2007), senders have used a multitude of sanction designs to achieve their desired goals. It is also not at all evident that sanctions aimed at goals other than democratization would have the unexpected and in some cases even undesired effect of causing regime change. For instance, we cannot expect sanctions aimed at ending nuclear weapon proliferation to have the same democratic effect as a sanction purposefully designed to instigate democratic reforms, such as introduction of multiparty elections or reinstatement of an elected civilian leadership. In earlier research on sanctions and democratization, sanctions have not been clearly separated in relation to their explicit goal. Thereby, the question of democratic sanction effectiveness has been left largely unanswered. In our study on sanctions and democratization, we are therefore especially interested in the democratic effect of those sanctions that explicitly aim to increase the level of democracy in the targeted country. A New Data Set on Sanctions  We introduce a new data set of EU, UN, and US sanctions against authoritarian regimes in the period 1990-2010 and combine these data with standard indices of democracy to reinvestigate the effects of democratic sanctions. The new dataset is a vital asset to explore our research question and, in contrast to previous datasets on international sanctions, it clearly separates democratic sanctions from sanctions set out to achieve other objectives (Table 1). Our data set is composed of the entire universe of sanction regimes imposed by the UN, the US, and the EU (the main sanction senders) in the period 1990-2010, including those sanction regimes that were already in place in 1990 and those episodes that are still ongoing (Portela & von Soest 2012). Given that the investigation explores the impact of sanctions on authoritarian regimes, the data set only includes countries that the Hadenius, Teorell, and Wahman data set (2013) has coded as being ?nondemocratic regimes? at the start of the sanction episode. Table 1: Democratic and nondemocratic goals of sanctions. Authors? compilation. The article presents a number of statistical models to investigate the general democratic effects of sanctions. Table 2 shows a simplified presentation of the results by providing the average yearly change in democracy scores in countries targeted by different types of sanctions. The democracy index ranges between 0-10, where higher scores represent higher levels of democracy. Looking at all the different categories of sanctions presented in Table 1, our statistical analyses indicate that none of the imposed sanctions have been counterproductive to the democratic development of authoritarian regimes. Sanctions in general do not promote democratization, but democratic sanctions are significantly associated with higher levels of democracy in the targeted country. Our results are remarkable given that Peksen and Drury (2010) have shown that all sanctions have a robust negative impact on democracy. These findings show the importance of separating sanctions according to their explicit goal. When we look specifically at democratic sanctions, we observe much clearer positive outcomes than for all international sanctions combined. A potential problem with the results could be that democratic sanctions are generally more comprehensive than sanctions imposed to obtain other goals. Yet the variable remains significant when we control for these different measures. Table 2: Mean yearly change in democracy scores according to different sanction goals. Note: Sanctions are lagged one year. To study the more profound effects of democratic sanctions, we also tested whether democratic sanctions are associated with a higher rate of regime change and ruler exit. This provides an insight into how implemented democratic sanctions actually work in targeted authoritarian regimes and how they contribute to improved democracy levels. There is no general relationship between sanctions and a higher probability of rulers losing power. However, looking at only democratic sanctions, we see a significant positive relationship. It reaffirms Marinov?s (2005) finding that sanctions generally increase the probability of leadership exit. Such leadership exits can be an effect of leaders losing elections, being violently disposed from power or forced to resign. A brief glimpse at some sanction cases reveals that different mechanisms may account for increased democracy levels in targeted authoritarian regimes, with the two major ones being (1) elite splits (and, in turn, regime changes and leadership exit) and (2) democratic concessions without regime and/or leader change. In Guatemala (1993), for instance, the military ousted President Serrano ? who had unconstitutionally dissolved parliament and the judiciary ? after the US and its allies imposed sanctions. An interim president took over, and the country?s democratic institutions were restored. In Nicaragua (1996) and Thailand (1993), sanctions similarly contributed to regime change. However, democratic sanctions rarely manage to instantly create liberal democracies. More commonly, we see a regime trajectory where closed authoritarian regimes are replaced by some form of electoral authoritarianism. Although such transitions do not amount to a fully-fledged transition to democracy, they increase competition and increases prospects for future democratisation (Teorell 2010). In Peru, sanctions contributed to democratization without ruler change. When President Fujimori suspended the legislature and introduced rule by decree in 1992, the US withheld military assistance and economic aid and blocked Peru?s efforts to obtain loans from international financial institutions. In response, Fujimori agreed to hold elections and to reinstate formally democratic institutions. Although his presidential dominance persisted until 2000, Peru?s political system was liberalized, to some extent, for the remainder of his time in office (Collins 2009, pp.80-81). In this particular case we could, hence, observe both institutional change and democratization, without change in leadership. Since the end of the Cold War, democratization has motivated an overwhelming majority of sanctions directed towards authoritarian regimes. Previous literature gives little support for continuing the practice of sanctioning authoritarian regimes, especially if the aim is to induce democratization. It is suggested that sanctions are not only generally ineffective, but also counterproductive in increasing the level of democracy in the targeted countries. In our recently published study, we provide evidence to the contrary. We argue that empirical research on the effectiveness of sanction must take the explicit goal of sanctions into account. By concentrating only on sanctions aimed at increasing the level of democracy in the targeted authoritarian state, we found that these sanctions are indeed associated with increasing levels of democracy. Moreover, authoritarian regimes targeted by democratic sanctions are more likely to experience institutional and leadership change. These findings should not be taken as evidence to justify all types of sanctions in all contexts where democracy is on the decline. There are several examples of highly unsuccessful democratic sanctions in the past and we can be sure to see many more such examples in the future. However, the findings work to rebut earlier academic research on the ineffectiveness of democratic sanctions and offer a more nuanced picture of sanctions as a tool for promoting democracy abroad.

June 27, 2012 at 3:52 pm July 5, 2012 at 5:45 am Hearing most people here wallow in their pains of pursuit for education that their dreams are depended upon reminds me of my own past ed-fin-trap that i was in when i had lost my husband in a car accident in South Africa while we were living there, i had all the family burdens of responsibility hitched on my shoulders and even though i work at Singaporean embassy in Pretoria then didn?t make a different both in my financial needs and the pains i had to go through, as in one hand i needed emotional healing and relief and on the other all i needed was the financial boost to take care of my two children who were in the Pretoria University so that their education are not short lived but my embassy only decided to transfer me to Singapore embassy in New Zealand to help me get over the trauma of my late husband but could not help me with the most vital financial resources. As i turned to Junk Mail got some of my properties advertised, a buyer who came to buy some of my household items said ?madam don?t you think you will need this for your kids your said to be leaving behind, yes they will need it but at the moment whats more vital is their financials, as i yelled out that word unknowingly, the man bought what he could but as he was about to go he said to me, i wish i could help you and left. Two days later he rang me up and said ?Madam you said as you work at the Singapore embassy can you try this Scholarship Charity (www.globalscholarshipzzn.wix.com/globalscholarshipzzn) they are helping Asians, may you never know, i thanked him and boom i went to my computer though slightly discouraged looking at their funny website address, but when i looked them up and read their history and discovered why their site name look funny (Jewish community with love of money but hate lavish spending). I followed up their scholarship eligibility and applied for my two kids and when the draw award came out my daughter who was in her third year Micro Biology at University of Cape Town failed the award but my son who just graduated from Matric in 2009 worn the award and the award presentation took place in Singapore 15th July 2010, scholarship award certificate was received and in two days my son?s first year cash of $10,000 was wired into my account, even though my son?s tuition fee was far below that amount but it also helped with my daughter and other issues. My son worked hard and scored their average score marks and last year received his 2011 scholarship amount of $10,000 again.

The luckiest people in the world are those who can do something that sets their souls on fire.? Barrett says he found that for himself by serving in politics. ?I became enthralled with politics and public service,? he says. Although his own parents weren?t particularly interested in politics or public life, he says he was not without political precedent. A great-great-grandfather served one term in State Assembly in 1854, representing Door and Kewaunee counties. While in office, he raised money for a highway between Sturgeon Bay and Bailey?s Harbor, then went home and got the construction contract. ?I have a rich history of public service!? Barrett said with a laugh. He has found the greatest satisfaction in serving at the local level and just celebrated his 10th anniversary serving as Milwaukee?s mayor. ?Serving in the State Legislature, you?re flying at 4,000 to 5,000 feet,? he says. ?It?s a great honor to serve in Washington. There, you?re flying at about 35,000 feet. At the local level, you?re in the trenches. You have, on a daily basis, many, many more decisions. It?s a gritty job. You?re affecting people in their daily lives. I have been able to have an impact on the largest city in the state.? Barrett fielded several questions from the audience about initiatives he is working on for the city of Milwaukee. He is trying to lift teenagers out of poverty by providing educational opportunities and trying to place them in jobs. Milwaukee has one of the highest percentages of people who live in poverty, and for many of them jobs do not exist, he says. ?How do we convince them there is a correlation between school and work if they never see the work?? he asked. ?We are trying to place thousands of kids in jobs, and we have to give them a positive experience. If you want to break the cycle of poverty, you have to get these kids jobs.? Barrett says people tend to get more invested in the community the longer they?re there, and people underestimate how easy it is to get involved. ?The opportunities are there,? he says. ?You can?t be afraid of failure. In anything you do, you?re going to get knocked around and (learn) a lesson in humility. You pick yourself up and say, ?I?m going to keep going.?? As for the controversial topic of public funding for a new stadium for the Milwaukee Bucks, Barrett says, ?It?s like making chili right now. There?s never an exact recipe. As mayor of Milwaukee, my position is, of course I want the Bucks to stay in Milwaukee. But the entertainment serves all of southeastern Wisconsin. The poor are concentrated in the city. You can?t have the high percentage of people living in poverty carrying the load.? He says choice schools are here to stay and can offer a tax savings, but he also is a strong advocate for the public schools. ?There has to be better transparency in all schools,? Barrett says. ?You have to make sure the data are out there. You have to make sure you?re treating everybody fairly. What I?ve focused on is the fairness of the financing and the transparency.? Barrett says it?s important for him to be honest with his views. ?Politics works best when you have an honest exchange of ideas,? he says. ?Whether you win or lose, at least you?re making your case. There are sharp elbows in this business. But I?m not going to quiet my voice. I?m still going to raise the issues.? He says he loves the city of Milwaukee and feels that most of its neighborhoods are safe. ?What?s not safe is if you?re involved in illegal drugs, illegal guns, gangs,? he says. ?I still get excited about what I can do to make things better. Good things are happening in Milwaukee. I have never seen more energy among young people in Milwaukee than I see right now. They have an entrepreneurial spirit. I think people in America are returning to cities. There?s a lot going on. There?s a beat to it that I like.? Barrett says that he still has the passion for public service. ?I love working with people, I love solving problems,? he says. ?I don?t fall asleep at my desk because there?s always something going on. The one constant in cities is that they are always changing. The cities are the place immigrants have always come. They feel they can have the American dream there.?

My favourite memory has to be my first college soccer game, I was so privileged and excited to represent the university and surrounding community. ... Study in the USA Sports Scholarships and the Athletic Recruitment Process There are many opportunities to play sports at universities in the US. University sports programmes are offered at the varsity (organised competition between universities) and the intramural or club (participation-oriented, less competitive) level. While no scholarships are offered for participation in sports at the intramural or club levels, some universities offer sport scholarships at the varsity level to students who are academically-qualified for admission and very gifted in a particular sport. Sport scholarships are granted by the university athletic department. Athletic directors and coaches play a central role in award decision-making. Scholarships?are generally?awarded for the following sports: baseball, basketball, crew (rowing), cross-country, fencing, football (American), golf, gymnastics, ice hockey, indoor track, lacrosse, skiing, soccer, softball, swimming and diving, tennis, track and field, volleyball, water polo, women?s field hockey and wrestling. Scholarships are provided on a yearly basis, generally renewable for four years, the normal time required to complete a US undergraduate degree. Award amounts vary and can be anywhere from a few thousand dollars to full funding. Importantly, while playing for a college team on scholarship can pay for the cost of earning an undergraduate degree, you do not attend university solely to play your sport. Students with sports scholarships must be working toward an undergraduate degree (in any field offered by the university). There are no degrees in sports themselves, but students whose main interest is in sports can often take a degree in exercise science, physical therapy or a related field. Athletic associations govern college sports and set rules regarding scholarships and athletic recruitment. There are a number of associations that colleges or universities can join, most notably: National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) High school student athletes in the US are somewhat at an advantage to international students hoping to obtain a sport scholarship. They will likely have had some level of exposure to college and university coaches at local, regional and national competitions before the recruitment process begins. Their US-based coaches may have contacts within university programmes and university scouts may be tracking their progress in the news or at competitions. Therefore, engaging in the recruitment process to pursue their sport at the collegiate level can be somewhat more straightforward and will certainly start earlier than for an international athlete. That said, every year talented international students are successful in receiving scholarships in a variety of sports at a wide range of US universities every year. The important thing to remember, whichever avenue you choose to take to engage in the recruitment process, is that the earlier you start and the more time you put in, the more likely you are to achieve your goal. International student athletes have a few options available to them once they decide that they would like to be considered for a sport scholarship to study in the US: ""College Day proved imperative for me in securing my place at Northeastern. I built an invaluable link with an international admissions officer and later the soccer coaches which led to me being recruited as a student-athlete. Without College Day these links would not have been made, and I most probably would not be heading to Northeastern this August!"" - Sam, Northeastern University Website by Serious Web Support"

Illinois Wesleyan University junior Lukasz Sewera was recently named the recipient of a competitive Benjamin A. Gilman international scholarship. He is one of approximately 1,000 United States students selected annually to receive the prestigious scholarship, which is sponsored by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs at the U.S. Department of State. A biology major from Norridge, Ill., Sewera will study medical practice and policy with the Danish Institute for Study Abroad (DIS) in Copenhagen, Denmark. He was also the recipient of an approximately $4,000 scholarship from DIS, one of many scholarships awarded to Illinois Wesleyan students for international study in the coming year. Sewera is the fourth IWU student to receive the Benjamin A. Gilman scholarship in the last two years. Others who have received the scholarship are Brad Tieche, Celeste Nunez, and Angela Rumsey, all Class of 2009. The Gilman scholarship, which awards an average of $4,000 per student, aims to diversify students who study abroad by offering financial support and to promote non-traditional study abroad destinations. As part of the Gilman scholarship application, Sewera designed a follow-up project to his experience overseas. On the encouragement of International Office Director Stacey Shimizu, he will deliver a presentation in the spring that encourages science and pre-med students to study abroad, despite the perceived restrictions of their majors. Many Illinois Wesleyan students will further their education abroad with the help of scholarships this year.

                 LSC-CyFair Student Earns Prestigious International Gilman Scholarship and Heads to China to Study The Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship Program offers grants to study abroad students with limited financial means for international study and with the intent to better prepare students to assume significant roles in an increasingly global economy and interdependent world. During the Spring 2011 application cycle, the Gilman Scholarship Program received more than 2,600 applications for more than 500 awards.?  Ocampo said applying for this competitive scholarship was a team effort and she is thankful to ?her team? including professors Robert O?Brien and Carolyn Ho as well as scholarship advisor Lina Quintero, enlisted to help obtain necessary documentation. Receiving the Gilman scholarship was both humbling and a relief as she said she felt a huge weight lifted off her shoulders.  ?We believe Martha is the first Lone Star College System student to ever receive this honor in the 10-year history of the Gilman,? said O?Brien.? ?Martha, who is also getting one of the LSCS Study Abroad Scholarships, is a very driven student and is deserving of both the college and Gilman scholarships. It?s also quite an honor for LSC-CyFair as most of the recipients are from four-year universities.? Financial need is only one of the challenges that Ocampo has faced in her academic journey. She originally moved from Miami in 2007 to attend the Art Institute of Houston. Shortly thereafter, she became extremely ill with Ulcerative Colitis.  ?Little did I know it then, but I was about to embark on an arduous two-year journey of agonizing surgeries and even more agonizing recoveries,? she said. ?During those two years I did a lot of ?soul searching? and realized that I wanted to become a lawyer. I promised myself that if I was able to regain my health that I would return to school and do my best to reach my full academic potential.? After her last surgery in late 2009, she said she registered for Spring classes at LSC-CyFair because it was close to home and because it was economically viable.  ?Enrolling at LSC-CyFair was one of the best decisions I have ever made,? said Ocampo. ?Each semester I am blessed with professors who love what they do. The caliber of educators at LSC-CyFair, I feel, can compete with even the finest four-year university.? And this summer, Ocampo will be studying in China for four weeks with seven other study abroad students and two of those professors, O?Brien, who teaches history, and Ho, who teaches Chinese. ?I have always wanted to learn to speak Mandarin and I could not pass up the opportunity of learning it in China, where I will have constant interaction with the language,? she said. In addition, Ocampo believes participating in such a study abroad program will give her a competitive edge in being accepted into graduate school as well as aid her in her career.  ?Study Abroad will help me sharpen the cross-cultural skills that will be crucial to me in my future career,? she said. ?Potential employers like to see that you are not afraid to step out of your comfort zone and programs, like study abroad, help to reinforce that message.?

The Amigo Scholarship is a tuition-specific award and does not convert to a cash award if the recipient?s tuition is covered by other means, such as an assistantship or scholarship.

The Office of International Admissions will screen the nominations for eligibility (international student, admitted). If and when an awardee accepts an assistantship or any other award that covers the non-resident portion of tuition, graduate units must notify the Office of International Admissions and Graduate Studies so that the Amigo award can be awarded to another eligible nominee. The Scholarship may be renewed annually for up to two years (four semesters) for Master?s students and four years (eight semesters) for PHD students provided the student maintains enrollment in and completes 9 credit hours in the Fall and Spring semesters with a minimum 3.0 GPA.? A student who fails to meet the requirements loses the scholarship. NOTE:? Awardees who transfer from a master?s program to a doctoral program do not carry the Amigo award into the new degree program.

June 27, 2012 at 3:52 pm July 5, 2012 at 5:45 am Hearing most people here wallow in their pains of pursuit for education that their dreams are depended upon reminds me of my own past ed-fin-trap that i was in when i had lost my husband in a car accident in South Africa while we were living there, i had all the family burdens of responsibility hitched on my shoulders and even though i work at Singaporean embassy in Pretoria then didn?t make a different both in my financial needs and the pains i had to go through, as in one hand i needed emotional healing and relief and on the other all i needed was the financial boost to take care of my two children who were in the Pretoria University so that their education are not short lived but my embassy only decided to transfer me to Singapore embassy in New Zealand to help me get over the trauma of my late husband but could not help me with the most vital financial resources. As i turned to Junk Mail got some of my properties advertised, a buyer who came to buy some of my household items said ?madam don?t you think you will need this for your kids your said to be leaving behind, yes they will need it but at the moment whats more vital is their financials, as i yelled out that word unknowingly, the man bought what he could but as he was about to go he said to me, i wish i could help you and left. Two days later he rang me up and said ?Madam you said as you work at the Singapore embassy can you try this Scholarship Charity (www.globalscholarshipzzn.wix.com/globalscholarshipzzn) they are helping Asians, may you never know, i thanked him and boom i went to my computer though slightly discouraged looking at their funny website address, but when i looked them up and read their history and discovered why their site name look funny (Jewish community with love of money but hate lavish spending). I followed up their scholarship eligibility and applied for my two kids and when the draw award came out my daughter who was in her third year Micro Biology at University of Cape Town failed the award but my son who just graduated from Matric in 2009 worn the award and the award presentation took place in Singapore 15th July 2010, scholarship award certificate was received and in two days my son?s first year cash of $10,000 was wired into my account, even though my son?s tuition fee was far below that amount but it also helped with my daughter and other issues. My son worked hard and scored their average score marks and last year received his 2011 scholarship amount of $10,000 again.

Well the data tells us two different stories. less than 4% The Nottingham experience tells us that where opportunities are created and barriers to study abroad reduced, students do travel overseas for educational opportunities. About 23% of our undergraduate students spend some time overseas as part of their degree and we expect to reach our target of 25% of students undertaking an international experience as part of their degree by next year. Despite our successes, we still have a lot to do to reduce barriers further, including the bureaucratic hurdles around matching term dates, grade conversion and student housing arrangements, and the complacency and risk aversion among some students (as well as some academics). the standard ?9,000 tuition fee is reduced to just ?1,350 ?275 and  ?375 But, as the British Council report indicates, UK students are already studying overseas for all of their degree as an alternative to studying in the UK. report published for BIS Unless a student is on a ""full-ride"" scholarship package at a US university, they're going to have to find the full cost of tuition and living expenses upfront. Unless UK student loans are made available for study overseas, as is the case for American financial aid, studying an entire degree abroad will be limited to very well-off, the super bright or those showing the kind of sporting prowess valued by US universities. While the opportunities for full degree study overseas are becoming more prominent, the number of students able to undertake full degree study in another country will be limited unless the government allows student loans to be used internationally. Studying abroad as part of a UK degree is a great alternative that gives students the advantages of an educational experience overseas without some of the complications of diploma mobility. Universities in the UK need to do much more to meet the growing demand for an international experience by developing more exchange opportunities and thinking about what more can be done at home to take advantage of the highly international populations already on our campuses.

For Students Studying Abroad on UGA Exchange Programs and/or Approved External Programs Out-of-State Students on UGA Study Abroad and UGA Exchange Programs Out-of-state students will be charged tuition at the in-state rate for the credits earned through a UGA-sponsored study abroad and UGA exchange program.

Financial Aid and Satisfactory Academic Progress Financial aid recipients must show measurable progress toward earning a degree by successfully completing 67% of the credit hours they have attempted at the University of Georgia, plus any approved transfer credit.? As the academic calendars at universities in other parts of the world vary from the calendar at UGA, delays in posting international transfer credit is common and may result in a temporary loss of financial aid eligibility until UGA receives the study abroad program transcript, processes the earned transfer credit and recalculates a student's Academic Progress.

June 27, 2012 at 3:52 pm July 5, 2012 at 5:45 am Hearing most people here wallow in their pains of pursuit for education that their dreams are depended upon reminds me of my own past ed-fin-trap that i was in when i had lost my husband in a car accident in South Africa while we were living there, i had all the family burdens of responsibility hitched on my shoulders and even though i work at Singaporean embassy in Pretoria then didn?t make a different both in my financial needs and the pains i had to go through, as in one hand i needed emotional healing and relief and on the other all i needed was the financial boost to take care of my two children who were in the Pretoria University so that their education are not short lived but my embassy only decided to transfer me to Singapore embassy in New Zealand to help me get over the trauma of my late husband but could not help me with the most vital financial resources. As i turned to Junk Mail got some of my properties advertised, a buyer who came to buy some of my household items said ?madam don?t you think you will need this for your kids your said to be leaving behind, yes they will need it but at the moment whats more vital is their financials, as i yelled out that word unknowingly, the man bought what he could but as he was about to go he said to me, i wish i could help you and left. Two days later he rang me up and said ?Madam you said as you work at the Singapore embassy can you try this Scholarship Charity (www.globalscholarshipzzn.wix.com/globalscholarshipzzn) they are helping Asians, may you never know, i thanked him and boom i went to my computer though slightly discouraged looking at their funny website address, but when i looked them up and read their history and discovered why their site name look funny (Jewish community with love of money but hate lavish spending). I followed up their scholarship eligibility and applied for my two kids and when the draw award came out my daughter who was in her third year Micro Biology at University of Cape Town failed the award but my son who just graduated from Matric in 2009 worn the award and the award presentation took place in Singapore 15th July 2010, scholarship award certificate was received and in two days my son?s first year cash of $10,000 was wired into my account, even though my son?s tuition fee was far below that amount but it also helped with my daughter and other issues. My son worked hard and scored their average score marks and last year received his 2011 scholarship amount of $10,000 again.

Well the data tells us two different stories. less than 4% The Nottingham experience tells us that where opportunities are created and barriers to study abroad reduced, students do travel overseas for educational opportunities. About 23% of our undergraduate students spend some time overseas as part of their degree and we expect to reach our target of 25% of students undertaking an international experience as part of their degree by next year. Despite our successes, we still have a lot to do to reduce barriers further, including the bureaucratic hurdles around matching term dates, grade conversion and student housing arrangements, and the complacency and risk aversion among some students (as well as some academics). the standard ?9,000 tuition fee is reduced to just ?1,350 ?275 and  ?375 But, as the British Council report indicates, UK students are already studying overseas for all of their degree as an alternative to studying in the UK. report published for BIS Unless a student is on a ""full-ride"" scholarship package at a US university, they're going to have to find the full cost of tuition and living expenses upfront. Unless UK student loans are made available for study overseas, as is the case for American financial aid, studying an entire degree abroad will be limited to very well-off, the super bright or those showing the kind of sporting prowess valued by US universities. While the opportunities for full degree study overseas are becoming more prominent, the number of students able to undertake full degree study in another country will be limited unless the government allows student loans to be used internationally. Studying abroad as part of a UK degree is a great alternative that gives students the advantages of an educational experience overseas without some of the complications of diploma mobility. Universities in the UK need to do much more to meet the growing demand for an international experience by developing more exchange opportunities and thinking about what more can be done at home to take advantage of the highly international populations already on our campuses.

Staton, who just graduated from Lee University with a master's degree in theological studies, won the award after receiving the endorsement of the Noonday Rotary Club in Cleveland, Tenn. The scholarship covers tuition, fees, round-trip transportation and room and board for a full academic year of international study. ""Having worked almost 20 years in education, I assess Beth Staton as ranking in the top three or four of the 7,000-plus students with whom I have worked,"" said Terry Cross, dean of the School of Religion at Lee. ""Beth is the most motivated person that I have met in years and perhaps the most highly motivated student I have seen in a decade."" The purpose of the Ambassadorial Scholarship program is to further international understanding and friendly relations among people of different countries. The program sponsors several types of scholarships for undergraduate and graduate students as well as for qualified professionals pursuing vocational studies. After attending an outbound scholars seminar in Nashville, Tenn., in December, Staton will begin presenting her work on interfaith issues and the construction of difference to audiences abroad and in the United States. ""So many times we religion scholars experience resistance as we attempt to discuss our work and the many ways in which faith literally shapes the world,"" Staton said. ""I am happy that Rotary, a non-religious organization, has recognized the importance of this field of study and its potential for furthering peace through mutual understanding."" As part of the application process, Staton was required to select five institutions she would prefer to attend that would not further only her own research interests but also the goals of the Rotary Foundation. She selected schools in Ireland, England, Scotland, India and New Zealand. Staton and her husband, Jonathan, a Web designer, will learn this fall where she will be assigned to study. ""Interfaith dialogue offers great potential for the future of peaceful coexistence of persons from various faith traditions,"" Staton said. ""I hope to contribute to this discourse through personal involvement as well as future teaching and research. I see the Rotary Ambassadorial Scholarship program as a way to provide a solid groundwork for a career of service to these ideals."" Originally from Watkinsville, Staton is the daughter of Bob Wagner and Patti Ozmore Wagner. She received her bachelor's degree at Lee in 1998 and was named the winner of the sociology department award. After spending six years working full time, she returned to Lee in January 2004 to pursue a master's degree. Staton has served as the School of Religion's interim director of the religion core since 2005. While completing her postgraduate work, she has taught ""Introduction to Theology"" and been a guest lecturer for several religion courses at Lee. Before she leaves the country next summer on the Rotary scholarship, Staton will work full time for the School of Religion, teaching theology courses and working on special projects.

Land of ideas Financing your studies with a scholarship Depending on the country you come from and which subject you would like to study in Germany, there are different options for funding. Scholarships are offered by different institutions. DAAD scholarship database Types of support There are two forms of scholarships ? financial and non-monetary scholarships ? both of which are often coupled together: In the case of financial scholarships, the recipient is awarded a fixed amount, paid out on a monthly basis over a defined funding period. These types of scholarships are often full scholarships, i.e., they generally cover the applicant?s entire living expenses. Recipients of partial scholarships, however, are required to secure additional financial support to cover their living expenses. When awarded a full scholarship, recipients are generally not permitted to receive funding from other scholarships simultaneously. Tuition fees in Germany In addition to financial support, many institutions also offer non-monetary scholarships. Recipients are invited to workshops, lectures and scientific conferences where they also have the opportunity to network with other scholarship holders. In most cases, these non-monetary scholarship programmes aim to create a long-standing relationship between the scholarship holder and the institution well beyond the scholarship period.

 				   ETH Zurich supports excellent students wishing to pursue a Master?s degree at ETH with two scholarship programmes: Under the Excellence Scholarship & Opportunity Programme (ESOP) students receive a special scholarship for the duration of their programme as well as specific supervision. The scholarship covers the full study and living costs during their Master?s degree course. Under the Master Scholarship Programme (MSP) students receive a partial stipend during their Master?s degree course and the offer of an assistantship. Who can apply? The scholarship programmes are open to excellent students both from the ETH and from other universities (national and international) wishing to pursue their Master?s degree at ETH Zurich. The prerequisite is a very good result in their Bachelor?s. Students must belong to the best 10 percent of their Bachelor?s programme. The application consists of Plagiarism, negligent or intentional misinformation will lead to exclusion from the admission process or - if discovered later - to the revocation of the admission and of any scholarship. If you are applying for more than one Master?s programme, please submit a separate application form for each degree programme. Scholarship amount and duration The Excellence Scholarship consists of a grant covering living and study expenses (CHF 1,750 per month) as well as a tuition fee waiver. The scholarship begins when the student commences his or her Master?s degree and is awarded for the regular duration of the Master?s programme (three or four semesters). It is awarded independently of the scholarship holder?s financial situation. The Master Scholarship Programme consists of a partial stipend for living and study expenses (CHF 850 per month during the first semester and CHF 600 per month from the second semester onwards) as well as a tuition fee waiver. After the first semester there is the possibility of taking on an assistantship (with a payment of CHF 600 per month). The scholarship begins when the student commences his or her Master?s degree and is awarded for the regular duration of the Master?s programme (three or four semesters). It is awarded independently of the scholarship holder?s financial situation. The Master Scholarship Programme requires a financial contribution from the scholarship holder. The applications are evaluated by the Admissions Committees of the respective Master?s programmes. The final decision for awarding scholarships in the Excellence Scholarship & Opportunity Programme and in the Master Scholarship Programme rests with the Rector of the ETH. The number of annual scholarships depends on the availability of funds. Guidelines on how to write a pre-proposal"

777262,"Be the Best You Hospital of Tomorrow Find Scholarships to Study Abroad With a little work, you can find sources of aid to help pay for time studying in another country. We tend to think of college in terms of a journey. There's the higher-education path through high school, the various routes to financial aid, and the long road from your first freshman orientation to your degree. And one of the most rewarding parts of this metaphorical journey can also be an actual journey, if you take the opportunity to study abroad. Spending a summer, a semester, or even a year of your college experience outside the United States can expand your horizons, improve your second-language skills, and foster your learning both inside and outside the classroom. It may seem dauntingly expensive, but studying abroad as a college student is incredibly valuable?and it's the cheapest chance you'll ever get to spend a significant chunk of time overseas without actually moving. Furthermore, with a little work, you can find scholarships and financial assistance to defray quite a bit of the cost. Generally speaking, there are two major ways to move your studies outside the country. You can use a study abroad program affiliated with a college, or you can use an independent program such as IES, SIT, or AIFS. If you go or are planning to go to a college with a study abroad office, I'd recommend making them your first stop for a variety of reasons. First and most importantly, going through your own school means your program coordinators will already know your field of study, your transcript information, and your financials, and that will save you time. In addition, you'll know that the courses on offer are accredited and targeted toward students in your field, and you'll be able to hear firsthand from program participants. And, of course, you'll easily be able to find all of the financial aid options open to you.

777629,"the world?s leading website for students and scholars of international politics IR Theory and Practice Politics in Action ? UWE Bristol Gender and Sexuality NGOs and IGOs War and Peace Join the Team The Underestimated Effect of Democratic Sanctions The Underestimated Effect of Democratic Sanctions Christian von Soest and Michael Wahman Democratic sanctions have a bad reputation. For most people with even a slight interest in international politics, it is not particularly hard to find examples to support a generally sceptic view of sanctions as a tool for external democracy promotion. The authoritarian regime in Zimbabwe has been targeted by both EU and US sanctions since 2002, but the Mugabe regime has remained stable and maintained remarkably high levels of repression, showing no real signs of political liberalization. Similarly, the EU?s sanctions against its Eastern authoritarian neighbour, Belarus, have still not had any noticeable effects. Despite costly sanctions in place since 2004, President Lukashenko remains one of the last European dictators. Sanctions and Their Effect on Democratization Instigating democratization has been by far the most common goal of sanctions initiated by the United States, the European Union, and the United Nations against authoritarian regimes in the post-Cold War period. Given previous research on the democratic effects of sanctions, the frequent use of sanctions as a tool for democratization is rather surprising (Drury 1998; Haass 1998; Pape 1997). Number of international sanctions according to sanction goals. Source: Representation based on own data set. In a seminal and widely cited study, Peksen and Drury (2010) argued that sanctions have an adverse effect on the level of democracy in targeted countries. According to the logic presented by Peksen and Drury, the negative democratic effect of sanctions is a consequence of increased levels of repression used by political elites in targeted countries as they attempt to cope with increased domestic pressure (also Wood 2008). Indeed, severe and widespread repression has often followed international sanction as a means to fight off increased opposition. However, previous research in the comparative democratization literature have shown that economic stress is one of the most robust determinants of democratization and/or regime change in authoritarian regimes (e.g. Geddes 1999; Bueno de Mesquita & Smith 2010; Teorell 2010). Authoritarian regimes tend to survive with a mixed strategy of repression and co-optation (Rotberg 2007; Wintrobe 1998). Without the financial ability to co-opt counter elites, authoritarian regimes often resort to a strategy of increased repression. However, repression is generally a less efficient tool for long-term regime survival than co-optation (Bueno de Mesquita & Smith 2010; Gandhi & Przeworski 2007). Although often temporarily effective, repression is an imprecise instrument that often leads to an increase in both opposition support and levels of dissent (Lichbach 1987). As a consequence, economic downturn often results in regime accommodation or, even more dramatically, regime collapse. Sanctions can, if effectively designed and strategically imposed, be used to increase such economic pressure on authoritarian elites. Moreover, by targeting central elite figures or strategically important industries, sanctions can also effectively undermine the inner elite?s support for top-leaders or current institutions. Although the current literature on comparative democratization makes it plausible that sanctions could have a positive effect on the level of democracy in the targeted country, this is not to say that all sanctions necessarily have the same effect. As several authors have acknowledged (Kirshner 1997; Allen 2005; Hufbauer et al. 2007), senders have used a multitude of sanction designs to achieve their desired goals. It is also not at all evident that sanctions aimed at goals other than democratization would have the unexpected and in some cases even undesired effect of causing regime change. For instance, we cannot expect sanctions aimed at ending nuclear weapon proliferation to have the same democratic effect as a sanction purposefully designed to instigate democratic reforms, such as introduction of multiparty elections or reinstatement of an elected civilian leadership. In earlier research on sanctions and democratization, sanctions have not been clearly separated in relation to their explicit goal. Thereby, the question of democratic sanction effectiveness has been left largely unanswered. In our study on sanctions and democratization, we are therefore especially interested in the democratic effect of those sanctions that explicitly aim to increase the level of democracy in the targeted country. A New Data Set on Sanctions  We introduce a new data set of EU, UN, and US sanctions against authoritarian regimes in the period 1990-2010 and combine these data with standard indices of democracy to reinvestigate the effects of democratic sanctions. The new dataset is a vital asset to explore our research question and, in contrast to previous datasets on international sanctions, it clearly separates democratic sanctions from sanctions set out to achieve other objectives (Table 1). Our data set is composed of the entire universe of sanction regimes imposed by the UN, the US, and the EU (the main sanction senders) in the period 1990-2010, including those sanction regimes that were already in place in 1990 and those episodes that are still ongoing (Portela & von Soest 2012). Given that the investigation explores the impact of sanctions on authoritarian regimes, the data set only includes countries that the Hadenius, Teorell, and Wahman data set (2013) has coded as being ?nondemocratic regimes? at the start of the sanction episode. Table 1: Democratic and nondemocratic goals of sanctions. Authors? compilation. The article presents a number of statistical models to investigate the general democratic effects of sanctions. Table 2 shows a simplified presentation of the results by providing the average yearly change in democracy scores in countries targeted by different types of sanctions. The democracy index ranges between 0-10, where higher scores represent higher levels of democracy. Looking at all the different categories of sanctions presented in Table 1, our statistical analyses indicate that none of the imposed sanctions have been counterproductive to the democratic development of authoritarian regimes. Sanctions in general do not promote democratization, but democratic sanctions are significantly associated with higher levels of democracy in the targeted country. Our results are remarkable given that Peksen and Drury (2010) have shown that all sanctions have a robust negative impact on democracy. These findings show the importance of separating sanctions according to their explicit goal. When we look specifically at democratic sanctions, we observe much clearer positive outcomes than for all international sanctions combined. A potential problem with the results could be that democratic sanctions are generally more comprehensive than sanctions imposed to obtain other goals. Yet the variable remains significant when we control for these different measures. Table 2: Mean yearly change in democracy scores according to different sanction goals. Note: Sanctions are lagged one year. To study the more profound effects of democratic sanctions, we also tested whether democratic sanctions are associated with a higher rate of regime change and ruler exit. This provides an insight into how implemented democratic sanctions actually work in targeted authoritarian regimes and how they contribute to improved democracy levels. There is no general relationship between sanctions and a higher probability of rulers losing power. However, looking at only democratic sanctions, we see a significant positive relationship. It reaffirms Marinov?s (2005) finding that sanctions generally increase the probability of leadership exit. Such leadership exits can be an effect of leaders losing elections, being violently disposed from power or forced to resign. A brief glimpse at some sanction cases reveals that different mechanisms may account for increased democracy levels in targeted authoritarian regimes, with the two major ones being (1) elite splits (and, in turn, regime changes and leadership exit) and (2) democratic concessions without regime and/or leader change. In Guatemala (1993), for instance, the military ousted President Serrano ? who had unconstitutionally dissolved parliament and the judiciary ? after the US and its allies imposed sanctions. An interim president took over, and the country?s democratic institutions were restored. In Nicaragua (1996) and Thailand (1993), sanctions similarly contributed to regime change. However, democratic sanctions rarely manage to instantly create liberal democracies. More commonly, we see a regime trajectory where closed authoritarian regimes are replaced by some form of electoral authoritarianism. Although such transitions do not amount to a fully-fledged transition to democracy, they increase competition and increases prospects for future democratisation (Teorell 2010). In Peru, sanctions contributed to democratization without ruler change. When President Fujimori suspended the legislature and introduced rule by decree in 1992, the US withheld military assistance and economic aid and blocked Peru?s efforts to obtain loans from international financial institutions. In response, Fujimori agreed to hold elections and to reinstate formally democratic institutions. Although his presidential dominance persisted until 2000, Peru?s political system was liberalized, to some extent, for the remainder of his time in office (Collins 2009, pp.80-81). In this particular case we could, hence, observe both institutional change and democratization, without change in leadership. Since the end of the Cold War, democratization has motivated an overwhelming majority of sanctions directed towards authoritarian regimes. Previous literature gives little support for continuing the practice of sanctioning authoritarian regimes, especially if the aim is to induce democratization. It is suggested that sanctions are not only generally ineffective, but also counterproductive in increasing the level of democracy in the targeted countries. In our recently published study, we provide evidence to the contrary. We argue that empirical research on the effectiveness of sanction must take the explicit goal of sanctions into account. By concentrating only on sanctions aimed at increasing the level of democracy in the targeted authoritarian state, we found that these sanctions are indeed associated with increasing levels of democracy. Moreover, authoritarian regimes targeted by democratic sanctions are more likely to experience institutional and leadership change. These findings should not be taken as evidence to justify all types of sanctions in all contexts where democracy is on the decline. There are several examples of highly unsuccessful democratic sanctions in the past and we can be sure to see many more such examples in the future. However, the findings work to rebut earlier academic research on the ineffectiveness of democratic sanctions and offer a more nuanced picture of sanctions as a tool for promoting democracy abroad.

It is suggested that sanctions are not only generally ineffective, but also counterproductive in increasing the level of democracy in the targeted countries. In our recently published study, we provide evidence to the contrary. We argue that empirical research on the effectiveness of sanction must take the explicit goal of sanctions into account. By concentrating only on sanctions aimed at increasing the level of democracy in the targeted authoritarian state, we found that these sanctions are indeed associated with increasing levels of democracy. Moreover, authoritarian regimes targeted by democratic sanctions are more likely to experience institutional and leadership change. These findings should not be taken as evidence to justify all types of sanctions in all contexts where democracy is on the decline. There are several examples of highly unsuccessful democratic sanctions in the past and we can be sure to see many more such examples in the future. However, the findings work to rebut earlier academic research on the ineffectiveness of democratic sanctions and offer a more nuanced picture of sanctions as a tool for promoting democracy abroad.

Yes, I would like to receive news alerts from JapanToday Terms of Service Japan says sex slave issue not a diplomatic topic after Obama comments Japan warned the issue of its wartime system of sex slavery was not a ?diplomatic? subject, after U.S. President Barack Obama on Friday called it a ?terrible? violation of human rights. Katsunobu Kato, deputy chief cabinet secretary, said Japan was aware of the suffering of the victims and was trying to avoid politicizing the emotional issue. ?Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said he is deeply pained to think of the people who experienced immeasurable pain and suffering,? Kato said in a television program. ?This issue should not be made into a political or diplomatic subject,? he said. In a press conference in South Korea Friday, Obama called for an accounting of the wrongs perpetrated by Japanese troops before and during World War II when thousands of women were forced into prostitution, many from the Korean peninsula. ?This was a terrible, egregious violation of human rights. Those women were violated in ways that, even in the midst of war were shocking,? Obama said. But the U.S. president also pressed Tokyo and Seoul to look to the future. ?It is in the interests of both Japan and the Korean people to look forwards as well as backwards and to find ways in which the heartache and the pain of the past can be resolved,? Obama said. Washington finds it frustrating that its two major allies in the region are unable to resolve their issues and work together on other pressing issues, such as an increasingly strident China and Pyongyang?s nuclear weapons program. Despite formal apologies issued by the Japanese government, South Korea accuses Tokyo of failing sufficiently to atone for the ?comfort women?, who were pressed to service its troops during its brutal war of expansion. Japan previously used a quasi-public fund to give compensation accompanied by a letter of apology from the prime minister. But Japan has long maintained that the two nations have resolved reparation issues from the World War II by signing treaties. Japanese media said Obama was trying to urge both Tokyo and Seoul to stabilize their working relationship. Obama was calling on Japan to take proactive stance on the comfort women issue, while also pressing Seoul to overcome emotional reaction, the liberal Tokyo Shimbun said in an analysis. The influential Asahi Shimbun said South Korea might heighten pressure on Tokyo to address the comfort women issue after the Obama remark. But the daily also said a piece of American advice was also directed at South Korea. ?Obama is seen calling on South Korea to become more flexible because the future-oriented cooperation between Japan and South Korea has not been able to move forward as South Korea strongly remains hung up on the past history,? the Asahi said.
 
  Back to top Back to top Order by Time Order by Popularity Login to comment Login to comment Wow, impressive to see Japan standing up for themselves this way. It's about time. When you play the door mat diplomatically with westerners it will not work out for you, you have to show some back bone. Japan warned the issue of its wartime system of sex slavery was not a ?diplomatic? subject Of course it is, not only in the eyes of the US and South Korea as illustrated here, but also the dozens of other countries from whom women were taken and used as sex slaves by the IJA. It doesn't matter whether Japan likes this or not - it's just fact. So, Japan should stick by it's apology and never allow statements to be made by any officials that undermine the merits of the apology to the broader international community. These things should be sacrosanct and never tinkered with under any circumstances. I've said before that people will forgive providing they feel as though there is genuine contrition expressed. But they won't forget, and they certainly won't just sit idly by to let Japan try to revise it's history. President Obama is not man of his word, untrustworthy, a political opportunist, telling Heads of State and Government what they want to hear. This is President Obama political back to the future, for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, it's Senkaku Islands and security issues, for South Korean President Park Geun-Hye it comfort women and sex slaves. Pure and shameless opportunism, propagating a false empathy to garner future support, seemingly unbiased, but deliberately manipulative.  Chief Cabinet Secretary Y?hei K?no statement is equivocal: ""Undeniably, this was an act, with the involvement of the military authorities of the day, that severely injured the honour and dignity of many women. The Government of Japan would like to take this opportunity once again to extend its sincere apologies and remorse to all those, irrespective of place of origin, who suffered immeasurable pain and incurable physical and psychological wounds as comfort women""...... August 4, 1993 President Obama failed to draw on this statement choosing instead to grandstand to the populists.   President Obama's imminent visit to the Philippines, and the announcement of a new U.S. Philippine alliance agreement so allowing U.S. forces to return to the Philippines more than two decades after the US forces withdrew could indicate the US government current agenda. Japanese were all in love with Obama, until he said something they didn't like.
 
 Japanese were all in love with Caroline Kennedy, until she said something they didn't like.
 
 Japanese were all in love with Clinton, until she said something they didn't like.
 
 Japanese were all in love with Park, until she said something they didn't like. When will Japan learn that having good relations does not mean agreeing on everything and always being 'nice'.
 
 Time for Japan to wake up to the realities of international relations, or become isolated like North Korea. Yes, today Japan is a peaceful nation who offers a lot of aid, but the international community agrees Japan should do more to show a genuine attitude of remorse for its actions during the war. well said Obama. we in Indonesia have bad history by japan too, thou we not care anymore as we feel they are peace. But when they dont admit and try to revise (if there is), it opens the crack back.  it doesnt same for everyone. And the best to move is to recognize their own history and dared to faced it..
 
 If America just sided with Japan, it'll look bad for others..Some right wing japanese might never understood, just try to view history book of other nation, even in indonesia and what it means to us...We today not live in faction community, but openly connected world..America has to remain true to peace order of all nations, not just japan and represent the voice of others too This is not a political issue. It is a moral issue! Everybody knows there are no morals in politics! Let the next round of (never ending) white washing of what Japan did or didn't do in regards to comfort women issue begin. Sounds like the Japanese media is generally not critical of Obama's speech then, especially the more liberal ones. 
 
 Japan needs to be more ""pro-active"" (in other words do more) about the lack of atonement for comfort women, and S. Korea needs to be more flexible and less emotional. Sounds perfectly fair -  Come on Japan be the adult in this relationship and make a step. A letter from the emperor, or better yet, a law to ban denying comfort women! Then all this would be over in day! A letter from the emperor a law to ban denying comfort women! I disagree. No country should have laws on historical (re)interpretation. It is for academics to decide on history, not politicians. GalapagosnoGairaishuAPR. 26, 2014 - 06:06PM JST
 
 Obama dined on 30,000-yen sushi and then on his way out left behind a tur*d on Japan's doorstep. What a shocking lack of common sense. No, what he left was a dose of reality medicine. His views reflect the international community - there is a growing attitude of revisionism and denial in Japan and if it continues Japan will become increasingly isolated. I disagree. No country should have laws on historical (re)interpretation. It is for academics to decide on history, not politicians. Then tell that to Japanese politicians. They are constantly giving their own versions of history which do not agree with the majority. Make it law and you don't have the problem of revisionism. Igloobuyer@Smart diplomacy is the art of knowing when to keep one's mouth shut. If Obama had intended to lecture the Japanese on the errors of their ways, he should have done it to their faces, and not across the ""East Sea."" Barack Obama has warned North Korea over nuclear testing, there are clear indications this is the fourth nuclear test, there needs to be complete unity between all governments.  Hardly a word has been muttered unless it a insult, how does stating the obvious, in such a manner, bring forth a harmonious response? GalapagosnoGairaishuAPR. 26, 2014 - 06:25PM JST
 
   Igloobuyer@Smart diplomacy is the art of knowing when to keep one's mouth shut. If Obama had intended to lecture the Japanese on the errors of their ways, he should have done it to their faces, and not across the ""East Sea."" I see no lecturing in his statement. He just said Japan needs to be more pro-active and Korea needs to be less emotional. Now do you know he didn't bring it up with Abe anyway? This is one of the issues contributing to the current diplomatic rift. Of course it's a ""diplomatic topic."" Gimme a break. Now do you know he didn't bring it up with Abe anyway? Well letsbe@ Isn't that the whole point here? Whatever Obama and Abe discussed was carefully vetted by their handlers before served for public consumption. In Korean the finger-wagging was done at a televised press conference. I bet you a kilo of kimchi that no Korean will escape the impression that Obama has taken their country's side in this particular dispute. Crimson and Clover Germany never would have responded this way. And that folks explains why Germany does not get treated this way anymore. The only explanation I have for why Japan insists on shooting itself in the foot is a traditional inexperience with dealing with the rest of the world.   It takes a serious navel gazer to not understand where this reaction is going to go after the hundredth time of the same reaction. Our president is a true diplomatic fool!!! Real stupidity is the only thing that I can think of that would lead him bring up this issue. Why blame the present day government of Japan for something that took place during WWII? How many times do the world have to tell you? ""Comfort woman was NOT sex slave but prostetutes. THere is a lot of evidence or documents for that.""
 
 ""THere is NO evidece existing that ex-Japanese troop force these woman to have sex in organized manner, while there is an evidence of ex-japanese troop that issued to prohibit its army or locala bases from forcing these women to have sex"" Evdence is the only way to show what really happened. Did Obama make the statement about comfort women in Japan, South Korea, or in both countries? If he did not say it while in Japan then why say it at all? In South Korea he is just singing to the choir. I wud bet some ca$h that Obama DID mention the sex slave issue, IN PRIVATE, hoping Japan would man up & take responsibility, PUBLICLY..................but alas once again we see Japan likes to take the low road, she will never learn by the looks of it & continues to reap what she has sewn for many many decades & STILL counting hachikouAPR. 26, 2014 - 09:03PM JST

   ""Comfort woman was NOT sex slave but prostetutes. THere is a lot of evidence or documents for that."" ""THere is NO evidece existing that ex-Japanese troop force these woman to have sex in organized manner, while there is an evidence of ex-japanese troop that issued to prohibit its army or locala bases from forcing these women to have sex""
 
   Evdence is the only way to show what really happened. Sure, and there was no Nanking massacre, no 'death railway', no torture and starvation of POW's, yes, Japan liberated Asia from the oppressive Western colonialists. You go ahead and believe what you want to believe, and the world will go on and believe what overwhelming evidence shows and never the twain shall meet. So everyone trashed Abe for running everything by visiting Yasukuni.
 
 So what do we call Obama who has been working to resolve SK-JPN tensions for the sake
 
 of US regional strategic policy, even reaching a point where both countries are prepared to discuss
 
 the issue together, and he comes out with this utterly stupid counter productive comment? Hachikou >How many times do the world have to tell you? What planet are you living on? UN and rest of the world acknowledge that the Japanese army forced these young women into sexual slaves. It's not only Korea. Wormen but Chinese, Taiwanese, Dutch, and etc. UN report clearly states up to 200,000 women forced into sexual slavery. So stop pretending to deny this fact. Absolutelt agree with subyyaki. Japan shows more backbone compared to my mommy jeans wearing President. I just think it's just a matter of interpretation from the Japanese and SKorean's sides. I just think Pres. Obama is being neutral and just natural in abhorring comfort women issue as a form of degradation of women since they brand it as sexual slavery. But I just think he says to move on and meet halfway to resolve the historical issue. He's not really siding. Since as one poster said PM Abe's main agenda is the Senkakus which I think he won and not the comfort women issue. I applaud him for really knowing his priorities. Whereas in SKorea, they brought out the comfort women issue and Pres Obama of course responded as he did.  Nothing bad with his response, I think.  Only, the SKoreans overhyped the response of the US pres and claimed the US Pres is on their side which I think is not.
 
 @Hachikou, I partially agree with you! It is fact that innocent Chinese civilians were killed by ex-Japanese troop. But question is how many??
 
 1? 2 people? Chinese claims 300000people in Nankjin, which is impossible considering population there  at that time. Recently, Koreans found diray of the man working at comfort women facility. We are looking for that kind of evidence.
 
 Unfortunatly Korean says most of context is gone, so it doens'T show the evidence that Japanese forcing sex as a slave. ?This was a terrible, egregious violation of human rights. Those women were violated in ways that, even in the midst of war were shocking,?   Obama did an absolute right thing to speak for the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  Furthermore, Obama has every right to tell the world the simple fact, as a decent human being as well as a president represent the US: the sexual enslavement of women by Japanese imperial force brutally violated those victims? basic rights,  in any occasions he sees fit.  (it's not up to Japan's approval.) Japanese govt should recognize Japan's horrendous wartime crimes committed to humanity, and stop manipulating and whitewashing the facts. The more Japan wants to hide the truth; the worse the Japan?s public image is portrayed in the world community.  It is sample like that, but Abe & Co. still don't get it.

   So everyone trashed Abe for running everything by visiting Yasukuni. So what do we call Obama who has been working to resolve SK-JPN tensions for the sake of US regional strategic policy, even reaching a point where both countries are prepared to discuss the issue together, and he comes out with this utterly stupid counter productive comment? I'm interested to hear why it's counter-productive.  The way I see it; The 'comfort women; issues is the main cause of poor relations between Japan and Korea. America desperately wants its closest Asian allies to get on - so he wants to encourage Japan to be more pro-active with demonstrating greater remorse and atonement and Korea to be less emotional and more flexible.  How do you see it? Ilgoo, Counter-productive because the REAL issue which is supposed to be the one on the topic table is weathered by South Korea's manipulations to divert and mislead everyone away from the Takeshima/Dokdo dispute.That's the real cause of poor relationship between Japan and RoK. The whole comfort women issue is all but cover-ups! Did you heard anything from Mr.Obama about the Island? None! Japan wants to settle it through the ICJ but RoK refused. Instead RoK uses propaganda about Comfort Women. hachikouAPR. 26, 2014 - 10:20PM JST
 
   igloobuyer there was no Nanking massacre

   Asianhometown UN and rest of the world acknowledge ...
 
   You see, this is Exactly what I am talking about. Your logic is groundless. Instead of showing evidence , your logic is just ""everybody says blah bla blah"".
 
   Was any of UN member there at that facility during WW2? Name the witness! Show us the link. I would love to hear it. Originally Confort woman issue started from Japan not korea. Japan has been studied extensively including testimony and interview, whole nation wide debate had already done. Take a look at wikipedia. You will see the whole list of references and source of information.
 
   Recently, Koreans found diray of the man working at comfort women facility. We are looking for that kind of evidence. Unfortunatly Korean says most of context is gone, so it doens'T show the evidence that Japanese forcing sex as a slave. You want to believe that the Japanese military was no worse than any other. They weren't, they were far worse.  What you and many Japanese fail to accept is that Japan committed the most heinous and inhumane war crimes above and beyond those of any other nation (and not terribly far from those of Germany).
 
 You cannot go on denying the Nanking massacre, the death railway, comfort women and torture and starvation of thousands of POW's in countries throughout Asia were fabrications.  Japan, stand up, face the facts, bow humbly express genuine regret and never forget. 
 
 Then, finally, we can all move on. Do nothing and Japan's isolation will only deepen. Katsunobu Kato, deputy chief cabinet secretary, said Japan was aware of the suffering of the victims and was trying to avoid politicizing the emotional issue. Hypocrites.  Then how come the General Counsel from the Japanese Embassy in New York went to Palisades Park in New Jersey to meet with the town council there to try to prevail on them to take down their monument remembering the Korean sex slaves?  Guess it can only be ""politicized"" when it is Japan doing it. @letsberealistic, Japan's isolation will deepen? Isolation in what sense? How many times Jpolitician would vow down? It would never really end simply because they want a slice of Japan not just expression of remorse. I still stand with my belief that those women discovered prostitution as a way of survival during the war. For nowhere else could you find plenty of provisions other than the military camps during war. And those very same obaachans re-discovered that by wailing about how they were ""forced"" to prostitute themselves during war, could make their remaining life comfortable . titaniumdioxideAPR. 26, 2014 - 10:39PM JST
 
   Ilgoo, Counter-productive because the REAL issue which is supposed to be the one on the topic table is weathered by South Korea's manipulations to divert and mislead everyone away from the Takeshima/Dokdo dispute.That's the real cause of poor relationship between Japan and RoK. The whole comfort women issue is all but cover-ups! Did you heard anything from Mr.Obama about the Island? None! Japan wants to settle it through the ICJ but RoK refused. Instead RoK uses propaganda about Comfort Women. Oh, so you are deciding what the priority in improving relations, not Obama or Park? So, the comfort women issues is all just a 'cover up' a conspiracy to 'deflect' interest away from the 'real' issue of Takeshima/ Dokdo. Thank you for enlightening us with that piece of intelligent and informed revelation. letsberealisticAPR. 26, 2014 - 10:42PM JST
 
   hachikouAPR. 26, 2014 - 10:20PM JST igloobuyer there was no Nanking massacre It is fact that innocent Chinese civilians were killed by ex-Japanese troop. But question is how many?? 1? 2 people? Chinese claims 300000people in Nankjin, which is impossible considering population there at that time. Asianhometown UN and rest of the world acknowledge ... You see, this is Exactly what I am talking about. Your logic is groundless. Instead of showing evidence , your logic is just ""everybody says blah bla blah"". Was any of UN member there at that facility during WW2? Name the witness! Show us the link. I would love to hear it. Originally Confort woman issue started from Japan not korea. Japan has been studied extensively including testimony and interview, whole nation wide debate had already done. Take a look at wikipedia. You will see the whole list of references and source of information. Recently, Koreans found diray of the man working at comfort women facility. We are looking for that kind of evidence. Unfortunatly Korean says most of context is gone, so it doens'T show the evidence that Japanese forcing sex as a slave.
 
   You want to believe that the Japanese military was no worse than any other. They weren't, they were far worse.
 
   What you and many Japanese fail to accept is that Japan committed the most heinous and inhumane war crimes above and beyond those of any other nation (and not terribly far from those of Germany). You cannot go on denying the Nanking massacre, the death railway, comfort women and torture and starvation of thousands of POW's in countries throughout Asia were fabrications.
 
   Japan, stand up, face the facts, bow humbly express genuine regret and never forget. Then, finally, we can all move on. Do nothing and Japan's isolation will only deepen. Unrealistic BS!  Worse than two atomic bombs? Worse than Mao's greatest slaughter of millions of Chinese? Your definition of the word ""worse"" is subjective and is limited to yourself. You always talk about facts and Mr.hachikou is providing you one but you fail to acknowledge a single. Not very realistic! The real problem is Japanese think the  biggest mistake they regretted is they failed to win the WWII. Unrealistic BS! Worse than two atomic bombs? Worse than Mao's greatest slaughter of millions of Chinese? Your definition of the word ""worse"" is subjective and is limited to yourself. You always talk about facts and Mr.hachikou is providing you one but you fail to acknowledge a single. Not very realistic! Atomic bombing was a horrible act, brought on by a desperate US that could see Japan would fight until all were dead anyway - a horrible decision that some same had to be made, some say didn't. Maos' massacres were truly horrible and yes on a par, with Nanking and other Japanese massacres, but not, you did not happen during WW2 and were not committed by an invasionary foreign force but by their own people.  So, do you have anything on a par with what Japan did, during the war, that was not a desperate measure to end the war that seemed endless? I agree that Obama has done a bit of a snake act by waiting until he get to Korea to bring up this topic, but his Japan visit was more about socializing than discussing the issues at hand. There were no resolutions to the TPP or security and occupation by US troops. It was all beer and prawns! (Sake and sushi) - Obama's timing may not be great, but his point is relevant and must be addressed. I can just imagine Abe sitting back with his ten dollar sake saying, ""WTF? I thought we were best buddies!"" Pretty much what I thought would happen.  The US should not get involved unless it is prepared to mediate at a summit. Statements like this will only further highlight South Korea's and Japan's differences. A letter from the emperor
 
  Then some right-wing politician will say the Emperor was forced to write the letter and South Korea will reset relations to square 1 again. South Korea needs to say exactly what will put this issue permanently to bed. After that no whining about individual politicians saying X or doing Y. a law to ban denying comfort women! I disagree. No country should have laws on historical (re)interpretation. It is for academics to decide on history, not politicians. In Germany denying the Holocaust is a prosecutable crime.  Japan cannot claim a special dispensation, not with that giant precedent in effect for decades. ""Most historians"" ... is one of the most meaningless and overused memes in this debate. Most people cannot tell the difference between ""historians"" and ""war time propagandists"" past and current. Life is not a football game. I don't think like a nationalist. I don't own any people, they are not ""my people"". No Japanese alive today is guilty, nor needs to bear any guilt or shame for any action they did not carry out.  That is logical and that is the law.  They are no more or less guilty for others actions than you are. This is all a propaganda war. Elements within China, Korea, the USA wish to bow, damage or break today's Japanese, and damage public support for them abroad, e.g. in the USA. Many of those elements are government sponsored, they are encouraging a ripple of support amongst race haters. What a way to earn a living, or spend your life ... It and the conflict and hatred it encourages, is nothing more than a deluded and toxic mental pollution. There is always a price to pay, G7 group of nations agreed today to impose further sanctions on The Russia Federation, so that basically adds Japan to whatever ""significant impact"" these sanctions will take to stop Moscow backed pro-Russian separatist violence in eastern Ukraine. Also this morning pro-Russian separatists in Slavyansk are reportedly holding 13 Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe observers hostage. President Obama is requesting support for 2nd and 3rd stage sanctions, and EU governments are reticent, with Germany particularly resistant, if further UN resolutions are needed, then support in the shape of a positive vote, will be expected in return. Yes, that has be proven time and time again by studying the details and the provenance of the originals ... That was one of the issue with Iris Chang's campaign. It was shown to her and her publishers that a number of images were well known fabrication or falsely attributed and they refused to remove them. Punishment like stripping the flesh off things are not traditional Japanese punishments, which generally depended more on humiliation rather capital punishment. I am not a denier, I just get sick of these people peddling their nonsense generation after generation. That's why I just call them ""atrocity pornographers"".  There is no morality to their position, they just enjoy looking at and showing each other nasty pictures and calling girls bad names.  (*A simple truth folks,  More than 53% of Japanese are women and never had any part in anything you accuse, neither did the children who were made victims too, neither did the farmer who stayed at home and farmed, neither did the workers, neither even did the Navy or much of the army ... by the time you logically work out who might have been involved, it is down to a single % of the population,  less the a similar amount of criminals in any society, and a hell of a lot less than most societies*). After the war, the Germans and Japanese had a different reaction to their bad behavior during the war. Most of the Germans were remorseful and guilt ridden. The Japanese immediately tried to rewrite history, and are still at it. Within days of Japan's surrender in 1945, coded messages went out from Tokyo to Japanese diplomats around the world, ordering them to start a campaign portraying Japan as a victim in the war, and to play down Japanese atrocities and play up Japanese civilian losses in the recent atomic bomb attacks. What was not so secret were Japanese efforts to ignore the war and portray themselves as victims. Many Japanese opposed rewriting history, which was often quite blatant. This meddling with historical facts regularly caused problems with neighbors, especially Korea and China. But the Japanese were insistent on evading responsibility. They still are, and many Japanese really believe it. what South Korea failed to tell Obama is that they 1965 Treaty resolved all issues during Japan's Colonization of Korea, and Japan's past apologies.  Double Jeopardy? Japan has done that, yet Korea still plays the victim card, which it no longer is.  Korea have no shame. I agree with Obama, and I disagree with Japan -- it is a diplomatic topic.

They still are, and many Japanese really believe it. This is the crux of the problem and the reason why these Asian countries cannot move forward. Because the Japanese feel like they were the main victims of the war, it keeps throwing a sharp knife in the sides of the countries that were brutalized under the Japanse and this is the fundamental problem why the other countries equally will never let it rest. Compensation, smiles and handshakes are not enough. Had Germany gone the same route as Japan did, Europe would be a very different place today. Go to Germany and ask the average German about the war. Most Getmans think that part of their history was the worst and should never be repeated again. Everything was based on lies and they are ashamed of it. On the flip side, the Japanese think differently and for some reason it's everyone else's fault except Japan's. Had Japan gone the same route ad Germany, the relationship between Japan and Asia would have made this entire continent a mega powerhouse, stronger, wealthier, unstoppable.be that as it is Japan and this topic with its neighbors will never be resolved as long as Japan and it's sympathizers dig in their heels and play the card of victimization.

Yes, I would like to receive news alerts from JapanToday Terms of Service Japan says sex slave issue not a diplomatic topic after Obama comments Japan warned the issue of its wartime system of sex slavery was not a ?diplomatic? subject, after U.S. President Barack Obama on Friday called it a ?terrible? violation of human rights. Katsunobu Kato, deputy chief cabinet secretary, said Japan was aware of the suffering of the victims and was trying to avoid politicizing the emotional issue. ?Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said he is deeply pained to think of the people who experienced immeasurable pain and suffering,? Kato said in a television program. ?This issue should not be made into a political or diplomatic subject,? he said. In a press conference in South Korea Friday, Obama called for an accounting of the wrongs perpetrated by Japanese troops before and during World War II when thousands of women were forced into prostitution, many from the Korean peninsula. ?This was a terrible, egregious violation of human rights. Those women were violated in ways that, even in the midst of war were shocking,? Obama said. But the U.S. president also pressed Tokyo and Seoul to look to the future. ?It is in the interests of both Japan and the Korean people to look forwards as well as backwards and to find ways in which the heartache and the pain of the past can be resolved,? Obama said. Washington finds it frustrating that its two major allies in the region are unable to resolve their issues and work together on other pressing issues, such as an increasingly strident China and Pyongyang?s nuclear weapons program. Despite formal apologies issued by the Japanese government, South Korea accuses Tokyo of failing sufficiently to atone for the ?comfort women?, who were pressed to service its troops during its brutal war of expansion. Japan previously used a quasi-public fund to give compensation accompanied by a letter of apology from the prime minister. But Japan has long maintained that the two nations have resolved reparation issues from the World War II by signing treaties. Japanese media said Obama was trying to urge both Tokyo and Seoul to stabilize their working relationship. Obama was calling on Japan to take proactive stance on the comfort women issue, while also pressing Seoul to overcome emotional reaction, the liberal Tokyo Shimbun said in an analysis. The influential Asahi Shimbun said South Korea might heighten pressure on Tokyo to address the comfort women issue after the Obama remark. But the daily also said a piece of American advice was also directed at South Korea. ?Obama is seen calling on South Korea to become more flexible because the future-oriented cooperation between Japan and South Korea has not been able to move forward as South Korea strongly remains hung up on the past history,? the Asahi said.
 
  Back to top Back to top Order by Time Order by Popularity Login to comment Login to comment Wow, impressive to see Japan standing up for themselves this way. It's about time. When you play the door mat diplomatically with westerners it will not work out for you, you have to show some back bone. Japan warned the issue of its wartime system of sex slavery was not a ?diplomatic? subject Of course it is, not only in the eyes of the US and South Korea as illustrated here, but also the dozens of other countries from whom women were taken and used as sex slaves by the IJA. It doesn't matter whether Japan likes this or not - it's just fact. So, Japan should stick by it's apology and never allow statements to be made by any officials that undermine the merits of the apology to the broader international community. These things should be sacrosanct and never tinkered with under any circumstances. I've said before that people will forgive providing they feel as though there is genuine contrition expressed. But they won't forget, and they certainly won't just sit idly by to let Japan try to revise it's history. President Obama is not man of his word, untrustworthy, a political opportunist, telling Heads of State and Government what they want to hear. This is President Obama political back to the future, for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, it's Senkaku Islands and security issues, for South Korean President Park Geun-Hye it comfort women and sex slaves. Pure and shameless opportunism, propagating a false empathy to garner future support, seemingly unbiased, but deliberately manipulative.  Chief Cabinet Secretary Y?hei K?no statement is equivocal: ""Undeniably, this was an act, with the involvement of the military authorities of the day, that severely injured the honour and dignity of many women. The Government of Japan would like to take this opportunity once again to extend its sincere apologies and remorse to all those, irrespective of place of origin, who suffered immeasurable pain and incurable physical and psychological wounds as comfort women""...... August 4, 1993 President Obama failed to draw on this statement choosing instead to grandstand to the populists.   President Obama's imminent visit to the Philippines, and the announcement of a new U.S. Philippine alliance agreement so allowing U.S. forces to return to the Philippines more than two decades after the US forces withdrew could indicate the US government current agenda. Japanese were all in love with Obama, until he said something they didn't like.
 
 Japanese were all in love with Caroline Kennedy, until she said something they didn't like.
 
 Japanese were all in love with Clinton, until she said something they didn't like.
 
 Japanese were all in love with Park, until she said something they didn't like. When will Japan learn that having good relations does not mean agreeing on everything and always being 'nice'.
 
 Time for Japan to wake up to the realities of international relations, or become isolated like North Korea. Yes, today Japan is a peaceful nation who offers a lot of aid, but the international community agrees Japan should do more to show a genuine attitude of remorse for its actions during the war. well said Obama. we in Indonesia have bad history by japan too, thou we not care anymore as we feel they are peace. But when they dont admit and try to revise (if there is), it opens the crack back.  it doesnt same for everyone. And the best to move is to recognize their own history and dared to faced it..
 
 If America just sided with Japan, it'll look bad for others..Some right wing japanese might never understood, just try to view history book of other nation, even in indonesia and what it means to us...We today not live in faction community, but openly connected world..America has to remain true to peace order of all nations, not just japan and represent the voice of others too This is not a political issue. It is a moral issue! Everybody knows there are no morals in politics! Let the next round of (never ending) white washing of what Japan did or didn't do in regards to comfort women issue begin. Sounds like the Japanese media is generally not critical of Obama's speech then, especially the more liberal ones. 
 
 Japan needs to be more ""pro-active"" (in other words do more) about the lack of atonement for comfort women, and S. Korea needs to be more flexible and less emotional. Sounds perfectly fair -  Come on Japan be the adult in this relationship and make a step. A letter from the emperor, or better yet, a law to ban denying comfort women! Then all this would be over in day! A letter from the emperor a law to ban denying comfort women! I disagree. No country should have laws on historical (re)interpretation. It is for academics to decide on history, not politicians. GalapagosnoGairaishuAPR. 26, 2014 - 06:06PM JST
 
 Obama dined on 30,000-yen sushi and then on his way out left behind a tur*d on Japan's doorstep. What a shocking lack of common sense. No, what he left was a dose of reality medicine. His views reflect the international community - there is a growing attitude of revisionism and denial in Japan and if it continues Japan will become increasingly isolated. I disagree. No country should have laws on historical (re)interpretation. It is for academics to decide on history, not politicians. Then tell that to Japanese politicians. They are constantly giving their own versions of history which do not agree with the majority. Make it law and you don't have the problem of revisionism. Igloobuyer@Smart diplomacy is the art of knowing when to keep one's mouth shut. If Obama had intended to lecture the Japanese on the errors of their ways, he should have done it to their faces, and not across the ""East Sea."" Barack Obama has warned North Korea over nuclear testing, there are clear indications this is the fourth nuclear test, there needs to be complete unity between all governments.  Hardly a word has been muttered unless it a insult, how does stating the obvious, in such a manner, bring forth a harmonious response? GalapagosnoGairaishuAPR. 26, 2014 - 06:25PM JST
 
   Igloobuyer@Smart diplomacy is the art of knowing when to keep one's mouth shut. If Obama had intended to lecture the Japanese on the errors of their ways, he should have done it to their faces, and not across the ""East Sea."" I see no lecturing in his statement. He just said Japan needs to be more pro-active and Korea needs to be less emotional. Now do you know he didn't bring it up with Abe anyway? This is one of the issues contributing to the current diplomatic rift. Of course it's a ""diplomatic topic."" Gimme a break. Now do you know he didn't bring it up with Abe anyway? Well letsbe@ Isn't that the whole point here? Whatever Obama and Abe discussed was carefully vetted by their handlers before served for public consumption. In Korean the finger-wagging was done at a televised press conference. I bet you a kilo of kimchi that no Korean will escape the impression that Obama has taken their country's side in this particular dispute. Crimson and Clover Germany never would have responded this way. And that folks explains why Germany does not get treated this way anymore. The only explanation I have for why Japan insists on shooting itself in the foot is a traditional inexperience with dealing with the rest of the world.   It takes a serious navel gazer to not understand where this reaction is going to go after the hundredth time of the same reaction. Our president is a true diplomatic fool!!! Real stupidity is the only thing that I can think of that would lead him bring up this issue. Why blame the present day government of Japan for something that took place during WWII? How many times do the world have to tell you? ""Comfort woman was NOT sex slave but prostetutes. THere is a lot of evidence or documents for that.""
 
 ""THere is NO evidece existing that ex-Japanese troop force these woman to have sex in organized manner, while there is an evidence of ex-japanese troop that issued to prohibit its army or locala bases from forcing these women to have sex"" Evdence is the only way to show what really happened. Did Obama make the statement about comfort women in Japan, South Korea, or in both countries? If he did not say it while in Japan then why say it at all? In South Korea he is just singing to the choir. I wud bet some ca$h that Obama DID mention the sex slave issue, IN PRIVATE, hoping Japan would man up & take responsibility, PUBLICLY..................but alas once again we see Japan likes to take the low road, she will never learn by the looks of it & continues to reap what she has sewn for many many decades & STILL counting hachikouAPR. 26, 2014 - 09:03PM JST

""THere is NO evidece existing that ex-Japanese troop force these woman to have sex in organized manner, while there is an evidence of ex-japanese troop that issued to prohibit its army or locala bases from forcing these women to have sex""
 
   Evdence is the only way to show what really happened. Sure, and there was no Nanking massacre, no 'death railway', no torture and starvation of POW's, yes, Japan liberated Asia from the oppressive Western colonialists. You go ahead and believe what you want to believe, and the world will go on and believe what overwhelming evidence shows and never the twain shall meet. So everyone trashed Abe for running everything by visiting Yasukuni.
 
 So what do we call Obama who has been working to resolve SK-JPN tensions for the sake
 
 of US regional strategic policy, even reaching a point where both countries are prepared to discuss
 
 the issue together, and he comes out with this utterly stupid counter productive comment? Hachikou >How many times do the world have to tell you? What planet are you living on? UN and rest of the world acknowledge that the Japanese army forced these young women into sexual slaves. It's not only Korea. Wormen but Chinese, Taiwanese, Dutch, and etc. UN report clearly states up to 200,000 women forced into sexual slavery. So stop pretending to deny this fact. Absolutelt agree with subyyaki. Japan shows more backbone compared to my mommy jeans wearing President. I just think it's just a matter of interpretation from the Japanese and SKorean's sides. I just think Pres. Obama is being neutral and just natural in abhorring comfort women issue as a form of degradation of women since they brand it as sexual slavery. But I just think he says to move on and meet halfway to resolve the historical issue. He's not really siding. Since as one poster said PM Abe's main agenda is the Senkakus which I think he won and not the comfort women issue. I applaud him for really knowing his priorities. Whereas in SKorea, they brought out the comfort women issue and Pres Obama of course responded as he did.  Nothing bad with his response, I think.  Only, the SKoreans overhyped the response of the US pres and claimed the US Pres is on their side which I think is not.
 
 @Hachikou, I partially agree with you! It is fact that innocent Chinese civilians were killed by ex-Japanese troop. But question is how many??
 
 1? 2 people? Chinese claims 300000people in Nankjin, which is impossible considering population there  at that time. Recently, Koreans found diray of the man working at comfort women facility. We are looking for that kind of evidence.
 
 Unfortunatly Korean says most of context is gone, so it doens'T show the evidence that Japanese forcing sex as a slave. ?This was a terrible, egregious violation of human rights. Those women were violated in ways that, even in the midst of war were shocking,?   Obama did an absolute right thing to speak for the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  Furthermore, Obama has every right to tell the world the simple fact, as a decent human being as well as a president represent the US: the sexual enslavement of women by Japanese imperial force brutally violated those victims? basic rights,  in any occasions he sees fit.  (it's not up to Japan's approval.) Japanese govt should recognize Japan's horrendous wartime crimes committed to humanity, and stop manipulating and whitewashing the facts. The more Japan wants to hide the truth; the worse the Japan?s public image is portrayed in the world community.  It is sample like that, but Abe & Co. still don't get it.

I'm interested to hear why it's counter-productive.  The way I see it; The 'comfort women; issues is the main cause of poor relations between Japan and Korea. America desperately wants its closest Asian allies to get on - so he wants to encourage Japan to be more pro-active with demonstrating greater remorse and atonement and Korea to be less emotional and more flexible.  How do you see it? Ilgoo, Counter-productive because the REAL issue which is supposed to be the one on the topic table is weathered by South Korea's manipulations to divert and mislead everyone away from the Takeshima/Dokdo dispute.That's the real cause of poor relationship between Japan and RoK. The whole comfort women issue is all but cover-ups! Did you heard anything from Mr.Obama about the Island? None! Japan wants to settle it through the ICJ but RoK refused. Instead RoK uses propaganda about Comfort Women. hachikouAPR. 26, 2014 - 10:20PM JST

   You see, this is Exactly what I am talking about. Your logic is groundless. Instead of showing evidence , your logic is just ""everybody says blah bla blah"".
 
   Was any of UN member there at that facility during WW2? Name the witness! Show us the link. I would love to hear it. Originally Confort woman issue started from Japan not korea. Japan has been studied extensively including testimony and interview, whole nation wide debate had already done. Take a look at wikipedia. You will see the whole list of references and source of information.
 
   Recently, Koreans found diray of the man working at comfort women facility. We are looking for that kind of evidence. Unfortunatly Korean says most of context is gone, so it doens'T show the evidence that Japanese forcing sex as a slave. You want to believe that the Japanese military was no worse than any other. They weren't, they were far worse.  What you and many Japanese fail to accept is that Japan committed the most heinous and inhumane war crimes above and beyond those of any other nation (and not terribly far from those of Germany).
 
 You cannot go on denying the Nanking massacre, the death railway, comfort women and torture and starvation of thousands of POW's in countries throughout Asia were fabrications.  Japan, stand up, face the facts, bow humbly express genuine regret and never forget. 
 
 Then, finally, we can all move on. Do nothing and Japan's isolation will only deepen. Katsunobu Kato, deputy chief cabinet secretary, said Japan was aware of the suffering of the victims and was trying to avoid politicizing the emotional issue. Hypocrites.  Then how come the General Counsel from the Japanese Embassy in New York went to Palisades Park in New Jersey to meet with the town council there to try to prevail on them to take down their monument remembering the Korean sex slaves?  Guess it can only be ""politicized"" when it is Japan doing it. @letsberealistic, Japan's isolation will deepen? Isolation in what sense? How many times Jpolitician would vow down? It would never really end simply because they want a slice of Japan not just expression of remorse. I still stand with my belief that those women discovered prostitution as a way of survival during the war. For nowhere else could you find plenty of provisions other than the military camps during war. And those very same obaachans re-discovered that by wailing about how they were ""forced"" to prostitute themselves during war, could make their remaining life comfortable . titaniumdioxideAPR. 26, 2014 - 10:39PM JST

Worse than two atomic bombs? Worse than Mao's greatest slaughter of millions of Chinese? Your definition of the word ""worse"" is subjective and is limited to yourself. You always talk about facts and Mr.hachikou is providing you one but you fail to acknowledge a single. Not very realistic! The real problem is Japanese think the  biggest mistake they regretted is they failed to win the WWII. Unrealistic BS! Worse than two atomic bombs? Worse than Mao's greatest slaughter of millions of Chinese? Your definition of the word ""worse"" is subjective and is limited to yourself. You always talk about facts and Mr.hachikou is providing you one but you fail to acknowledge a single. Not very realistic! Atomic bombing was a horrible act, brought on by a desperate US that could see Japan would fight until all were dead anyway - a horrible decision that some same had to be made, some say didn't. Maos' massacres were truly horrible and yes on a par, with Nanking and other Japanese massacres, but not, you did not happen during WW2 and were not committed by an invasionary foreign force but by their own people.  So, do you have anything on a par with what Japan did, during the war, that was not a desperate measure to end the war that seemed endless? I agree that Obama has done a bit of a snake act by waiting until he get to Korea to bring up this topic, but his Japan visit was more about socializing than discussing the issues at hand. There were no resolutions to the TPP or security and occupation by US troops. It was all beer and prawns! (Sake and sushi) - Obama's timing may not be great, but his point is relevant and must be addressed. I can just imagine Abe sitting back with his ten dollar sake saying, ""WTF? I thought we were best buddies!"" Pretty much what I thought would happen.  The US should not get involved unless it is prepared to mediate at a summit. Statements like this will only further highlight South Korea's and Japan's differences. A letter from the emperor
 
  Then some right-wing politician will say the Emperor was forced to write the letter and South Korea will reset relations to square 1 again. South Korea needs to say exactly what will put this issue permanently to bed. After that no whining about individual politicians saying X or doing Y. a law to ban denying comfort women! I disagree. No country should have laws on historical (re)interpretation. It is for academics to decide on history, not politicians. In Germany denying the Holocaust is a prosecutable crime.  Japan cannot claim a special dispensation, not with that giant precedent in effect for decades. ""Most historians"" ... is one of the most meaningless and overused memes in this debate. Most people cannot tell the difference between ""historians"" and ""war time propagandists"" past and current. Life is not a football game. I don't think like a nationalist. I don't own any people, they are not ""my people"". No Japanese alive today is guilty, nor needs to bear any guilt or shame for any action they did not carry out.  That is logical and that is the law.  They are no more or less guilty for others actions than you are. This is all a propaganda war. Elements within China, Korea, the USA wish to bow, damage or break today's Japanese, and damage public support for them abroad, e.g. in the USA. Many of those elements are government sponsored, they are encouraging a ripple of support amongst race haters. What a way to earn a living, or spend your life ... It and the conflict and hatred it encourages, is nothing more than a deluded and toxic mental pollution. There is always a price to pay, G7 group of nations agreed today to impose further sanctions on The Russia Federation, so that basically adds Japan to whatever ""significant impact"" these sanctions will take to stop Moscow backed pro-Russian separatist violence in eastern Ukraine. Also this morning pro-Russian separatists in Slavyansk are reportedly holding 13 Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe observers hostage. President Obama is requesting support for 2nd and 3rd stage sanctions, and EU governments are reticent, with Germany particularly resistant, if further UN resolutions are needed, then support in the shape of a positive vote, will be expected in return. Yes, that has be proven time and time again by studying the details and the provenance of the originals ... That was one of the issue with Iris Chang's campaign. It was shown to her and her publishers that a number of images were well known fabrication or falsely attributed and they refused to remove them. Punishment like stripping the flesh off things are not traditional Japanese punishments, which generally depended more on humiliation rather capital punishment. I am not a denier, I just get sick of these people peddling their nonsense generation after generation. That's why I just call them ""atrocity pornographers"".  There is no morality to their position, they just enjoy looking at and showing each other nasty pictures and calling girls bad names.  (*A simple truth folks,  More than 53% of Japanese are women and never had any part in anything you accuse, neither did the children who were made victims too, neither did the farmer who stayed at home and farmed, neither did the workers, neither even did the Navy or much of the army ... by the time you logically work out who might have been involved, it is down to a single % of the population,  less the a similar amount of criminals in any society, and a hell of a lot less than most societies*). After the war, the Germans and Japanese had a different reaction to their bad behavior during the war. Most of the Germans were remorseful and guilt ridden. The Japanese immediately tried to rewrite history, and are still at it. Within days of Japan's surrender in 1945, coded messages went out from Tokyo to Japanese diplomats around the world, ordering them to start a campaign portraying Japan as a victim in the war, and to play down Japanese atrocities and play up Japanese civilian losses in the recent atomic bomb attacks. What was not so secret were Japanese efforts to ignore the war and portray themselves as victims. Many Japanese opposed rewriting history, which was often quite blatant. This meddling with historical facts regularly caused problems with neighbors, especially Korea and China. But the Japanese were insistent on evading responsibility. They still are, and many Japanese really believe it. what South Korea failed to tell Obama is that they 1965 Treaty resolved all issues during Japan's Colonization of Korea, and Japan's past apologies.  Double Jeopardy? Japan has done that, yet Korea still plays the victim card, which it no longer is.  Korea have no shame. I agree with Obama, and I disagree with Japan -- it is a diplomatic topic.

Because the Japanese feel like they were the main victims of the war, it keeps throwing a sharp knife in the sides of the countries that were brutalized under the Japanse and this is the fundamental problem why the other countries equally will never let it rest. Compensation, smiles and handshakes are not enough. Had Germany gone the same route as Japan did, Europe would be a very different place today. Go to Germany and ask the average German about the war. Most Getmans think that part of their history was the worst and should never be repeated again. Everything was based on lies and they are ashamed of it. On the flip side, the Japanese think differently and for some reason it's everyone else's fault except Japan's. Had Japan gone the same route ad Germany, the relationship between Japan and Asia would have made this entire continent a mega powerhouse, stronger, wealthier, unstoppable.be that as it is Japan and this topic with its neighbors will never be resolved as long as Japan and it's sympathizers dig in their heels and play the card of victimization.

Hobbies and Interests Types of Private Student Loans Student Loans to Cover Living Expenses Graduate Student Loans from Private Lenders Saving for College With an increasingly globalized economy and workforce, many college students are looking to gain a broader understanding of the world around them. One of the ways to do this is to pursue a degree in International Studies. International studies can take on a variety of models. Some universities offer International Affairs degrees, while others allow a student to pursue a international minor within business or economics.
 
   This gives students who are looking for scholarships and financial aid the ability to look to a number of sources for money to help pay for college. study abroad scholarships But what about paying for international study here at home? A great place to start looking for money to pay for your international studies degree is with internship and fellowship programs. Since international affairs degrees are very much geared towards the professional world, on-the-job experience is on the utmost importance. As a result, many foundations and government organizations (like the U.S. State Department) have programs that give students the opportunity to work either domestically with an international organization, or to work abroad for the semester or a summer. In many cases, the program will also provide tuition assistance and stipends. The Woodrow Wilson Undergraduate Fellowship is one of the most coveted scholarships for foreign affairs, and includes a $50,000 award for students interested in the Foreign Service. Another great source of scholarships for international studies is professional organizations. Many organizations like Women in International trade will reach out to younger potential members by offering scholarships for undergraduate and graduate study. These funds can generally be applied to study both at a U.S. institution, and abroad. At the graduate level, often the best source of scholarship funds for international affairs majors is the institutions themselves. There are many endowed scholarships available through the financial aid offices of some of the major international affairs programs. Finding a scholarship for a degree in International Affairs can start in many places. Sometimes you can find a scholarship for study of a particular geographical area, or combine your interest in international affairs with another related major like law or political science.

UWE Bristol Gender and Sexuality NGOs and IGOs War and Peace Join the Team The Underestimated Effect of Democratic Sanctions The Underestimated Effect of Democratic Sanctions Christian von Soest and Michael Wahman Democratic sanctions have a bad reputation. For most people with even a slight interest in international politics, it is not particularly hard to find examples to support a generally sceptic view of sanctions as a tool for external democracy promotion. The authoritarian regime in Zimbabwe has been targeted by both EU and US sanctions since 2002, but the Mugabe regime has remained stable and maintained remarkably high levels of repression, showing no real signs of political liberalization. Similarly, the EU?s sanctions against its Eastern authoritarian neighbour, Belarus, have still not had any noticeable effects. Despite costly sanctions in place since 2004, President Lukashenko remains one of the last European dictators. Sanctions and Their Effect on Democratization Instigating democratization has been by far the most common goal of sanctions initiated by the United States, the European Union, and the United Nations against authoritarian regimes in the post-Cold War period. Given previous research on the democratic effects of sanctions, the frequent use of sanctions as a tool for democratization is rather surprising (Drury 1998; Haass 1998; Pape 1997). Number of international sanctions according to sanction goals. Source: Representation based on own data set. In a seminal and widely cited study, Peksen and Drury (2010) argued that sanctions have an adverse effect on the level of democracy in targeted countries. According to the logic presented by Peksen and Drury, the negative democratic effect of sanctions is a consequence of increased levels of repression used by political elites in targeted countries as they attempt to cope with increased domestic pressure (also Wood 2008). Indeed, severe and widespread repression has often followed international sanction as a means to fight off increased opposition. However, previous research in the comparative democratization literature have shown that economic stress is one of the most robust determinants of democratization and/or regime change in authoritarian regimes (e.g. Geddes 1999; Bueno de Mesquita & Smith 2010; Teorell 2010). Authoritarian regimes tend to survive with a mixed strategy of repression and co-optation (Rotberg 2007; Wintrobe 1998). Without the financial ability to co-opt counter elites, authoritarian regimes often resort to a strategy of increased repression. However, repression is generally a less efficient tool for long-term regime survival than co-optation (Bueno de Mesquita & Smith 2010; Gandhi & Przeworski 2007). Although often temporarily effective, repression is an imprecise instrument that often leads to an increase in both opposition support and levels of dissent (Lichbach 1987). As a consequence, economic downturn often results in regime accommodation or, even more dramatically, regime collapse. Sanctions can, if effectively designed and strategically imposed, be used to increase such economic pressure on authoritarian elites. Moreover, by targeting central elite figures or strategically important industries, sanctions can also effectively undermine the inner elite?s support for top-leaders or current institutions. Although the current literature on comparative democratization makes it plausible that sanctions could have a positive effect on the level of democracy in the targeted country, this is not to say that all sanctions necessarily have the same effect. As several authors have acknowledged (Kirshner 1997; Allen 2005; Hufbauer et al. 2007), senders have used a multitude of sanction designs to achieve their desired goals. It is also not at all evident that sanctions aimed at goals other than democratization would have the unexpected and in some cases even undesired effect of causing regime change. For instance, we cannot expect sanctions aimed at ending nuclear weapon proliferation to have the same democratic effect as a sanction purposefully designed to instigate democratic reforms, such as introduction of multiparty elections or reinstatement of an elected civilian leadership. In earlier research on sanctions and democratization, sanctions have not been clearly separated in relation to their explicit goal. Thereby, the question of democratic sanction effectiveness has been left largely unanswered. In our study on sanctions and democratization, we are therefore especially interested in the democratic effect of those sanctions that explicitly aim to increase the level of democracy in the targeted country. A New Data Set on Sanctions  We introduce a new data set of EU, UN, and US sanctions against authoritarian regimes in the period 1990-2010 and combine these data with standard indices of democracy to reinvestigate the effects of democratic sanctions. The new dataset is a vital asset to explore our research question and, in contrast to previous datasets on international sanctions, it clearly separates democratic sanctions from sanctions set out to achieve other objectives (Table 1). Our data set is composed of the entire universe of sanction regimes imposed by the UN, the US, and the EU (the main sanction senders) in the period 1990-2010, including those sanction regimes that were already in place in 1990 and those episodes that are still ongoing (Portela & von Soest 2012). Given that the investigation explores the impact of sanctions on authoritarian regimes, the data set only includes countries that the Hadenius, Teorell, and Wahman data set (2013) has coded as being ?nondemocratic regimes? at the start of the sanction episode. Table 1: Democratic and nondemocratic goals of sanctions. Authors? compilation. The article presents a number of statistical models to investigate the general democratic effects of sanctions. Table 2 shows a simplified presentation of the results by providing the average yearly change in democracy scores in countries targeted by different types of sanctions. The democracy index ranges between 0-10, where higher scores represent higher levels of democracy. Looking at all the different categories of sanctions presented in Table 1, our statistical analyses indicate that none of the imposed sanctions have been counterproductive to the democratic development of authoritarian regimes. Sanctions in general do not promote democratization, but democratic sanctions are significantly associated with higher levels of democracy in the targeted country. Our results are remarkable given that Peksen and Drury (2010) have shown that all sanctions have a robust negative impact on democracy. These findings show the importance of separating sanctions according to their explicit goal. When we look specifically at democratic sanctions, we observe much clearer positive outcomes than for all international sanctions combined. A potential problem with the results could be that democratic sanctions are generally more comprehensive than sanctions imposed to obtain other goals. Yet the variable remains significant when we control for these different measures. Table 2: Mean yearly change in democracy scores according to different sanction goals. Note: Sanctions are lagged one year. To study the more profound effects of democratic sanctions, we also tested whether democratic sanctions are associated with a higher rate of regime change and ruler exit. This provides an insight into how implemented democratic sanctions actually work in targeted authoritarian regimes and how they contribute to improved democracy levels. There is no general relationship between sanctions and a higher probability of rulers losing power. However, looking at only democratic sanctions, we see a significant positive relationship. It reaffirms Marinov?s (2005) finding that sanctions generally increase the probability of leadership exit. Such leadership exits can be an effect of leaders losing elections, being violently disposed from power or forced to resign. A brief glimpse at some sanction cases reveals that different mechanisms may account for increased democracy levels in targeted authoritarian regimes, with the two major ones being (1) elite splits (and, in turn, regime changes and leadership exit) and (2) democratic concessions without regime and/or leader change. In Guatemala (1993), for instance, the military ousted President Serrano ? who had unconstitutionally dissolved parliament and the judiciary ? after the US and its allies imposed sanctions. An interim president took over, and the country?s democratic institutions were restored. In Nicaragua (1996) and Thailand (1993), sanctions similarly contributed to regime change. However, democratic sanctions rarely manage to instantly create liberal democracies. More commonly, we see a regime trajectory where closed authoritarian regimes are replaced by some form of electoral authoritarianism. Although such transitions do not amount to a fully-fledged transition to democracy, they increase competition and increases prospects for future democratisation (Teorell 2010). In Peru, sanctions contributed to democratization without ruler change. When President Fujimori suspended the legislature and introduced rule by decree in 1992, the US withheld military assistance and economic aid and blocked Peru?s efforts to obtain loans from international financial institutions. In response, Fujimori agreed to hold elections and to reinstate formally democratic institutions. Although his presidential dominance persisted until 2000, Peru?s political system was liberalized, to some extent, for the remainder of his time in office (Collins 2009, pp.80-81). In this particular case we could, hence, observe both institutional change and democratization, without change in leadership. Since the end of the Cold War, democratization has motivated an overwhelming majority of sanctions directed towards authoritarian regimes. Previous literature gives little support for continuing the practice of sanctioning authoritarian regimes, especially if the aim is to induce democratization. It is suggested that sanctions are not only generally ineffective, but also counterproductive in increasing the level of democracy in the targeted countries. In our recently published study, we provide evidence to the contrary. We argue that empirical research on the effectiveness of sanction must take the explicit goal of sanctions into account. By concentrating only on sanctions aimed at increasing the level of democracy in the targeted authoritarian state, we found that these sanctions are indeed associated with increasing levels of democracy. Moreover, authoritarian regimes targeted by democratic sanctions are more likely to experience institutional and leadership change. These findings should not be taken as evidence to justify all types of sanctions in all contexts where democracy is on the decline. There are several examples of highly unsuccessful democratic sanctions in the past and we can be sure to see many more such examples in the future. However, the findings work to rebut earlier academic research on the ineffectiveness of democratic sanctions and offer a more nuanced picture of sanctions as a tool for promoting democracy abroad.

LHU student receives scholarship to study in Ukraine Post a comment LOCK HAVEN - Lock Haven University student Thomas Lazzarevich has been awarded a Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship in the amount of $5,000. Lazzarevich, a sophomore history major from Trevorton, Pa., will attend Chernivtsi National University in Chernivtsi, Ukraine, where he will study Russian language and Ukrainian culture. The Gilman International Scholarship Program is sponsored by the by the U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, and is administered by the Institute of International Education (IIE). In offering grants for U.S. undergraduates to study abroad, the program seeks ""to prepare students to assume significant roles in an increasingly global economy and interdependent world."" Gilman award recipients are chosen by a competitive selection process. During the fall 2010 application cycle, the Gilman Scholarship Program received over 3,000 applications for 1,000 possible awards. According to Rosanna Campbell, assistant director of international studies, ""This makes Thomas the seventh LHU students to receive a prestigious study abroad award since 2006."" She added, ""I am very happy for Thomas, who will spend an entire academic year in Ukraine, as well as excited about LHU's continued successful record in this program."" Lazzarevich is a graduate of Line Mountain Junior/Senior High School in Herndon, Pa. Between his junior and senior years in high school, he went to Australia for the 2008 World Youth Day in Sydney. ""My experience in Australia only helped to increase my desire to study abroad in college,"" he said. His interest in international study was a main factor in Lazzarevich's college choice. ""One of the main reasons that I decided to attend Lock Haven University was the fact that it has such an excellent study abroad program,"" he said. He was also encouraged by family members who had studied abroad. These were two cousins, his brother's fiance and his other brother's wife, Jessica Ernest, who had also attended LHU. ""Once I started college,"" said Lazzarevich, ""I began to research what country I wanted to study in."" Assistant Professor Brian Ardan urged him to think beyond the ""usuals"" and to consider ""more exotic and under-visited countries."" Eventually, Arden invited him to dinner at his home, along with two Ukrainian students. ""After that dinner I knew that Ukraine was the place that I wanted to go."" Lazzarevich is preparing himself for an exciting year. ""I don't really know what the future has in store for me and I have no plans, but I'm really hoping that Ukraine has something new to offer that will decide my life,"" he said. ""I'm definitely open for a life-changing experience."" He also expressed his gratitude to the Benjamin A. Gilman Scholarship Program. ""I would really like to thank the Gilman Scholarship program for the generous scholarship that they awarded me. Without the money that I received I don't think that I would be able to afford this experience."" Lazzarevich is the son of Peter and Elizabeth Lazzarevich.

Along the way you?ll cultivate relationships in your community and mentor some outstanding scholars. What kind of scholarship can I offer? Start by deciding what kind of scholar you would like to support. Consider the age range, level of study, professional goals, location, community needs, and what you want to achieve. Scholarships can range from short-term studies in your community to a graduate degree program abroad. Examples include: How can I fund my scholarship? Depending on the scholarship you design, you can seek funding through a Rotary grant. Best Practices for District Grant Scholarships How do I get started? Club and district responsibilities for scholarships range from mentoring students to providing funding, depending on the type of grant. First, determine who will manage the process. Creating a scholarships subcommittee is a good idea if you don?t already have one. Rotarians who were involved in Ambassadorial Scholarships can be a great asset to your committee. Districts also need to complete Rotary?s grant qualification process. How can I apply for a Rotary scholarship?

Gilman International Scholarship Program for Undergraduates to Study Abroad View this Opportunity's Website View this Opportunity's Website International experience is critically important in the educational and career development of American students, but it can also require a substantial financial investment. The Gilman Scholarship Program broadens the student population that studies abroad by supporting undergraduates who might not otherwise participate due to financial constraints. The program aims to encourage students to choose non-traditional study abroad destinations, especially those outside of Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand. The Gilman Scholarship Program aims to support students who have been traditionally under-represented in study abroad, including but not limited to, students with high financial need, community college students, students in under-represented fields such as the sciences and engineering, students with diverse ethnic backgrounds, and students with disabilities. The program seeks to assist students from a diverse range of public and private institutions from all 50 states, Washington, DC and Puerto Rico.
 
 
 
  Over 2,300 scholarships of up to $5,000 will be awarded this academic year for U.S. citizen undergraduates to study abroad. Award amounts will vary depending on the length of study and student need with the average award being approximately $4,000.
 
 
 
  Students who apply for and receive the Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship to study abroad are then eligible to receive an additional $3,000 Critical Need Language Supplement from the Gilman Scholarship Program for a total possible award of up to $8,000.

To RSVP email Melanie Halpern at mhalpern@yivo.cjh.org. Click here to view membership benefits and to become a YIVO Member. Join us in celebrating Cecile Kuznitz?s (Bard College) new book, YIVO and the Making of Modern Jewish Culture: Scholarship for the Yiddish Nation (Cambridge University Press), the first history of YIVO. Founded by a group of East European intellectuals after World War I, YIVO became the apex of secular Yiddish culture and the premier institution of Diaspora Nationalism, which fought for Jewish rights in the lands of their residence. This roundtable explores the history of YIVO, its role in Jewish nationalism, and the relationship between Jewish cultural and political work in interwar Eastern Europe. Cecile Kuznitz is Associate Professor of Jewish history and Director of Jewish Studies at Bard College. She received her Ph.D. in modern Jewish history from Stanford University and previously taught at Georgetown University. She has held fellowships at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies, and the Center for Advanced Judaic Studies at the University of Pennsylvania. In summer 2013 she was a Visiting Scholar at Vilnius University. She is the author of several articles on the history of the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, the Jewish community of Vilna, and the field of Yiddish Studies. Her book on Yiddish scholarship between the two World Wars titled YIVO and the Making of Modern Jewish Culture is forthcoming from Cambridge University Press. Samuel Kassow, Charles H. Northam Professor of History at Trinity College, is recognized as one of the world?s leading scholars on the Holocaust, and on the Jews of Poland. Kassow was born in 1946 in a DP-camp in Stuttgart, Germany and grew up speaking Yiddish. He immigrated to the United States as a child. Kassow attended the London School of Economics and Princeton University where he earned a PhD in 1976 with a study about students and professors in Tsarist Russia. He is widely known for his 2007 book, Who Will Write Our History? Emanuel Ringelblum, the Warsaw Ghetto, and the Oyneg Shabes Archive (Indiana University Press). He has been elected a Fellow of the American Academy for Jewish Research, won numerous awards, and lectured widely. Simon Rabinovitch is Assistant Professor of History at Boston University, where he has been teaching since 2009. In 2010 he was appointed to a three-year career development professorship named in honor of Peter T. Paul (2010-13). He spent 2011-12 as a Research Fellow at the University of Helsinki?s Collegium for Advanced Studies and as a Visiting Scholar (February/March 2012) at Tel-Aviv University?s Goldstein-Goren Diaspora Research Center. He has been an Associate of the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University since 2010. Rabinovitch?s published work has examined different aspects of Jewish intellectual history, Jewish politics in revolutionary Russia, and the history of folklore and ethnography. He is also an occasional contributor to Haaretz (English) and an editor at The Marginalia Review of Books. Steven Zipperstein, Daniel E. Koshland Professor in Jewish Culture and History at Stanford University, is the author of several acclaimed books, including The Jews of Odessa: A Cultural History, 1794-1881 (Stanford University Press), Imagining Russian Jewry: Memory, History, Identity (University of Washington Press) and Elusive Prophet: Ahad Ha?am and the Origins of Zionism (University of California). For sixteen years, between 1991-2007, Dr. Zipperstein was Director of the Taube Center for Jewish Studies at Stanford which emerged as one of the leading programs in the field under his leadership. He is the recipient of numerous awards, including the Koret Award for contributions to American Jewish life. Dr. Steven Zipperstein is the inaugural Jacob Kronhill Visiting Scholar in History at YIVO for the Spring 2014 semester. During this time, Dr. Zipperstein will lead a graduate seminar on Jewish historiography, and will teach a public evening course, Jews and the Russian Revolution.

The luckiest people in the world are those who can do something that sets their souls on fire.? Barrett says he found that for himself by serving in politics. ?I became enthralled with politics and public service,? he says. Although his own parents weren?t particularly interested in politics or public life, he says he was not without political precedent. A great-great-grandfather served one term in State Assembly in 1854, representing Door and Kewaunee counties. While in office, he raised money for a highway between Sturgeon Bay and Bailey?s Harbor, then went home and got the construction contract. ?I have a rich history of public service!? Barrett said with a laugh. He has found the greatest satisfaction in serving at the local level and just celebrated his 10th anniversary serving as Milwaukee?s mayor. ?Serving in the State Legislature, you?re flying at 4,000 to 5,000 feet,? he says. ?It?s a great honor to serve in Washington. There, you?re flying at about 35,000 feet. At the local level, you?re in the trenches. You have, on a daily basis, many, many more decisions. It?s a gritty job. You?re affecting people in their daily lives. I have been able to have an impact on the largest city in the state.? Barrett fielded several questions from the audience about initiatives he is working on for the city of Milwaukee. He is trying to lift teenagers out of poverty by providing educational opportunities and trying to place them in jobs. Milwaukee has one of the highest percentages of people who live in poverty, and for many of them jobs do not exist, he says. ?How do we convince them there is a correlation between school and work if they never see the work?? he asked. ?We are trying to place thousands of kids in jobs, and we have to give them a positive experience. If you want to break the cycle of poverty, you have to get these kids jobs.? Barrett says people tend to get more invested in the community the longer they?re there, and people underestimate how easy it is to get involved. ?The opportunities are there,? he says. ?You can?t be afraid of failure. In anything you do, you?re going to get knocked around and (learn) a lesson in humility. You pick yourself up and say, ?I?m going to keep going.?? As for the controversial topic of public funding for a new stadium for the Milwaukee Bucks, Barrett says, ?It?s like making chili right now. There?s never an exact recipe. As mayor of Milwaukee, my position is, of course I want the Bucks to stay in Milwaukee. But the entertainment serves all of southeastern Wisconsin. The poor are concentrated in the city. You can?t have the high percentage of people living in poverty carrying the load.? He says choice schools are here to stay and can offer a tax savings, but he also is a strong advocate for the public schools. ?There has to be better transparency in all schools,? Barrett says. ?You have to make sure the data are out there. You have to make sure you?re treating everybody fairly. What I?ve focused on is the fairness of the financing and the transparency.? Barrett says it?s important for him to be honest with his views. ?Politics works best when you have an honest exchange of ideas,? he says. ?Whether you win or lose, at least you?re making your case. There are sharp elbows in this business. But I?m not going to quiet my voice. I?m still going to raise the issues.? He says he loves the city of Milwaukee and feels that most of its neighborhoods are safe. ?What?s not safe is if you?re involved in illegal drugs, illegal guns, gangs,? he says. ?I still get excited about what I can do to make things better. Good things are happening in Milwaukee. I have never seen more energy among young people in Milwaukee than I see right now. They have an entrepreneurial spirit. I think people in America are returning to cities. There?s a lot going on. There?s a beat to it that I like.? Barrett says that he still has the passion for public service. ?I love working with people, I love solving problems,? he says. ?I don?t fall asleep at my desk because there?s always something going on. The one constant in cities is that they are always changing. The cities are the place immigrants have always come. They feel they can have the American dream there.?

777364,"? Back to the Newswire Miami sophomore wins Boren Scholarship for International Study OXFORD, OH (05/13/2013)(readMedia)-- Kayla Orta, a Warrenton resident and sophomore at Miami University, has received a 2013 National Security Education Program (NSEP Boren Scholarship for International Study. The $20,000 scholarship will support her study in Seoul, South Korea, with the CIEE Korean Studies Summer Program and at Yonsei University in Wonju, South Korea, during the fall semester with the Farmer School of Business exchange program. She will focus on the conflict between North and South Korea and on intensive Korean language study. Orta, an international studies and individualized studies double major and German minor from Warrenton, Va., is one of 161 recipients from among 947 applicants nationwide for the Boren Scholarship.  Funded by the NSEP, the scholarships provide American undergraduate students with resources and encouragement to acquire skills and experiences in areas of the world critical to U.S. national security, in exchange for their commitment to seek work in the federal government. Orta's interest in Korean studies lies in the Korean language ? ""which I love,"" she said ? and in the political and cultural conflict between North and South Korea ? an issue that she is ""absolutely fascinated by."" She will focus on both during her study in South Korea. International studies and four languages ""I was originally drawn to Korean language studies through the discovery of K-pop. ... I loved it instantly,"" Orta explained. ""When I was applying for colleges, I specifically chose universities that offered Korean."" ""Once at Miami, I decided to major in both international studies and foreign languages.  But because Miami doesn't offer a major for more than two languages, I've been working through the individualized studies program to create my own major.""  
 
 That major is ""Languaculturalism: Relations in Communication."" It focuses on the importance of learning culture at the same time as learning a language, said Orta, and includes studying four languages: German, Korean, Chinese and Ancient Greek.  NSEP Service Requirement for Boren Scholars The NSEP Service Requirement stipulates that an award recipient work for a year in the federal government in a position with national security responsibilities. 
 
 ""Because of its importance, I've put a lot of thought into this. I really want ...to find a position that not only satisfies the requirement but also fulfills my interests and aspirations,"" Orta said. ""My dream job is to work with people from another country in their own language, simultaneously working to understand their culture and be in a position to communicate their opinions or needs back to the United States.  My study abroad programs, which focus on Korean language and North-South Korean conflict studies, will definitely prepare me for this."" She would eventually like to apply for a job or an internship with the U.S. Department of State Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs. Orta is a member of Miami's Korean American Student Association (KASA), serving as webmaster; next spring she will be co-president of the organization. She is an active member of Liberty in North Korea (LiNK), which next year will join with KASA to form a combined club. This past summer she studied in Germany through Miami's Intensive German Summer Program. This year she was the Thompson Hall /Clawson Hall senator representative for Associated Student Government (ASG); was Thompson Hall Community Council president; and has been nominated for the College of Arts and Science Ambassador program.

Yes, I would like to receive news alerts from JapanToday Terms of Service Japan says sex slave issue not a diplomatic topic after Obama comments Japan warned the issue of its wartime system of sex slavery was not a ?diplomatic? subject, after U.S. President Barack Obama on Friday called it a ?terrible? violation of human rights. Katsunobu Kato, deputy chief cabinet secretary, said Japan was aware of the suffering of the victims and was trying to avoid politicizing the emotional issue. ?Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said he is deeply pained to think of the people who experienced immeasurable pain and suffering,? Kato said in a television program. ?This issue should not be made into a political or diplomatic subject,? he said. In a press conference in South Korea Friday, Obama called for an accounting of the wrongs perpetrated by Japanese troops before and during World War II when thousands of women were forced into prostitution, many from the Korean peninsula. ?This was a terrible, egregious violation of human rights. Those women were violated in ways that, even in the midst of war were shocking,? Obama said. But the U.S. president also pressed Tokyo and Seoul to look to the future. ?It is in the interests of both Japan and the Korean people to look forwards as well as backwards and to find ways in which the heartache and the pain of the past can be resolved,? Obama said. Washington finds it frustrating that its two major allies in the region are unable to resolve their issues and work together on other pressing issues, such as an increasingly strident China and Pyongyang?s nuclear weapons program. Despite formal apologies issued by the Japanese government, South Korea accuses Tokyo of failing sufficiently to atone for the ?comfort women?, who were pressed to service its troops during its brutal war of expansion. Japan previously used a quasi-public fund to give compensation accompanied by a letter of apology from the prime minister. But Japan has long maintained that the two nations have resolved reparation issues from the World War II by signing treaties. Japanese media said Obama was trying to urge both Tokyo and Seoul to stabilize their working relationship. Obama was calling on Japan to take proactive stance on the comfort women issue, while also pressing Seoul to overcome emotional reaction, the liberal Tokyo Shimbun said in an analysis. The influential Asahi Shimbun said South Korea might heighten pressure on Tokyo to address the comfort women issue after the Obama remark. But the daily also said a piece of American advice was also directed at South Korea. ?Obama is seen calling on South Korea to become more flexible because the future-oriented cooperation between Japan and South Korea has not been able to move forward as South Korea strongly remains hung up on the past history,? the Asahi said.
 
  Back to top Back to top Order by Time Order by Popularity Login to comment Login to comment Wow, impressive to see Japan standing up for themselves this way. It's about time. When you play the door mat diplomatically with westerners it will not work out for you, you have to show some back bone. Japan warned the issue of its wartime system of sex slavery was not a ?diplomatic? subject Of course it is, not only in the eyes of the US and South Korea as illustrated here, but also the dozens of other countries from whom women were taken and used as sex slaves by the IJA. It doesn't matter whether Japan likes this or not - it's just fact. So, Japan should stick by it's apology and never allow statements to be made by any officials that undermine the merits of the apology to the broader international community. These things should be sacrosanct and never tinkered with under any circumstances. I've said before that people will forgive providing they feel as though there is genuine contrition expressed. But they won't forget, and they certainly won't just sit idly by to let Japan try to revise it's history. President Obama is not man of his word, untrustworthy, a political opportunist, telling Heads of State and Government what they want to hear. This is President Obama political back to the future, for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, it's Senkaku Islands and security issues, for South Korean President Park Geun-Hye it comfort women and sex slaves. Pure and shameless opportunism, propagating a false empathy to garner future support, seemingly unbiased, but deliberately manipulative.  Chief Cabinet Secretary Y?hei K?no statement is equivocal: ""Undeniably, this was an act, with the involvement of the military authorities of the day, that severely injured the honour and dignity of many women. The Government of Japan would like to take this opportunity once again to extend its sincere apologies and remorse to all those, irrespective of place of origin, who suffered immeasurable pain and incurable physical and psychological wounds as comfort women""...... August 4, 1993 President Obama failed to draw on this statement choosing instead to grandstand to the populists.   President Obama's imminent visit to the Philippines, and the announcement of a new U.S. Philippine alliance agreement so allowing U.S. forces to return to the Philippines more than two decades after the US forces withdrew could indicate the US government current agenda. Japanese were all in love with Obama, until he said something they didn't like.
 
 Japanese were all in love with Caroline Kennedy, until she said something they didn't like.
 
 Japanese were all in love with Clinton, until she said something they didn't like.
 
 Japanese were all in love with Park, until she said something they didn't like. When will Japan learn that having good relations does not mean agreeing on everything and always being 'nice'.
 
 Time for Japan to wake up to the realities of international relations, or become isolated like North Korea. Yes, today Japan is a peaceful nation who offers a lot of aid, but the international community agrees Japan should do more to show a genuine attitude of remorse for its actions during the war. well said Obama. we in Indonesia have bad history by japan too, thou we not care anymore as we feel they are peace. But when they dont admit and try to revise (if there is), it opens the crack back.  it doesnt same for everyone. And the best to move is to recognize their own history and dared to faced it..
 
 If America just sided with Japan, it'll look bad for others..Some right wing japanese might never understood, just try to view history book of other nation, even in indonesia and what it means to us...We today not live in faction community, but openly connected world..America has to remain true to peace order of all nations, not just japan and represent the voice of others too This is not a political issue. It is a moral issue! Everybody knows there are no morals in politics! Let the next round of (never ending) white washing of what Japan did or didn't do in regards to comfort women issue begin. Sounds like the Japanese media is generally not critical of Obama's speech then, especially the more liberal ones. 
 
 Japan needs to be more ""pro-active"" (in other words do more) about the lack of atonement for comfort women, and S. Korea needs to be more flexible and less emotional. Sounds perfectly fair -  Come on Japan be the adult in this relationship and make a step. A letter from the emperor, or better yet, a law to ban denying comfort women! Then all this would be over in day! A letter from the emperor a law to ban denying comfort women! I disagree. No country should have laws on historical (re)interpretation. It is for academics to decide on history, not politicians. GalapagosnoGairaishuAPR. 26, 2014 - 06:06PM JST
 
 Obama dined on 30,000-yen sushi and then on his way out left behind a tur*d on Japan's doorstep. What a shocking lack of common sense. No, what he left was a dose of reality medicine. His views reflect the international community - there is a growing attitude of revisionism and denial in Japan and if it continues Japan will become increasingly isolated. I disagree. No country should have laws on historical (re)interpretation. It is for academics to decide on history, not politicians. Then tell that to Japanese politicians. They are constantly giving their own versions of history which do not agree with the majority. Make it law and you don't have the problem of revisionism. Igloobuyer@Smart diplomacy is the art of knowing when to keep one's mouth shut. If Obama had intended to lecture the Japanese on the errors of their ways, he should have done it to their faces, and not across the ""East Sea."" Barack Obama has warned North Korea over nuclear testing, there are clear indications this is the fourth nuclear test, there needs to be complete unity between all governments.  Hardly a word has been muttered unless it a insult, how does stating the obvious, in such a manner, bring forth a harmonious response? GalapagosnoGairaishuAPR. 26, 2014 - 06:25PM JST
 
   Igloobuyer@Smart diplomacy is the art of knowing when to keep one's mouth shut. If Obama had intended to lecture the Japanese on the errors of their ways, he should have done it to their faces, and not across the ""East Sea."" I see no lecturing in his statement. He just said Japan needs to be more pro-active and Korea needs to be less emotional. Now do you know he didn't bring it up with Abe anyway? This is one of the issues contributing to the current diplomatic rift. Of course it's a ""diplomatic topic."" Gimme a break. Now do you know he didn't bring it up with Abe anyway? Well letsbe@ Isn't that the whole point here? Whatever Obama and Abe discussed was carefully vetted by their handlers before served for public consumption. In Korean the finger-wagging was done at a televised press conference. I bet you a kilo of kimchi that no Korean will escape the impression that Obama has taken their country's side in this particular dispute. Crimson and Clover Germany never would have responded this way. And that folks explains why Germany does not get treated this way anymore. The only explanation I have for why Japan insists on shooting itself in the foot is a traditional inexperience with dealing with the rest of the world.   It takes a serious navel gazer to not understand where this reaction is going to go after the hundredth time of the same reaction. Our president is a true diplomatic fool!!! Real stupidity is the only thing that I can think of that would lead him bring up this issue. Why blame the present day government of Japan for something that took place during WWII? How many times do the world have to tell you? ""Comfort woman was NOT sex slave but prostetutes. THere is a lot of evidence or documents for that.""
 
 ""THere is NO evidece existing that ex-Japanese troop force these woman to have sex in organized manner, while there is an evidence of ex-japanese troop that issued to prohibit its army or locala bases from forcing these women to have sex"" Evdence is the only way to show what really happened. Did Obama make the statement about comfort women in Japan, South Korea, or in both countries? If he did not say it while in Japan then why say it at all? In South Korea he is just singing to the choir. I wud bet some ca$h that Obama DID mention the sex slave issue, IN PRIVATE, hoping Japan would man up & take responsibility, PUBLICLY..................but alas once again we see Japan likes to take the low road, she will never learn by the looks of it & continues to reap what she has sewn for many many decades & STILL counting hachikouAPR. 26, 2014 - 09:03PM JST

""THere is NO evidece existing that ex-Japanese troop force these woman to have sex in organized manner, while there is an evidence of ex-japanese troop that issued to prohibit its army or locala bases from forcing these women to have sex""
 
   Evdence is the only way to show what really happened. Sure, and there was no Nanking massacre, no 'death railway', no torture and starvation of POW's, yes, Japan liberated Asia from the oppressive Western colonialists. You go ahead and believe what you want to believe, and the world will go on and believe what overwhelming evidence shows and never the twain shall meet. So everyone trashed Abe for running everything by visiting Yasukuni.
 
 So what do we call Obama who has been working to resolve SK-JPN tensions for the sake
 
 of US regional strategic policy, even reaching a point where both countries are prepared to discuss
 
 the issue together, and he comes out with this utterly stupid counter productive comment? Hachikou >How many times do the world have to tell you? What planet are you living on? UN and rest of the world acknowledge that the Japanese army forced these young women into sexual slaves. It's not only Korea. Wormen but Chinese, Taiwanese, Dutch, and etc. UN report clearly states up to 200,000 women forced into sexual slavery. So stop pretending to deny this fact. Absolutelt agree with subyyaki. Japan shows more backbone compared to my mommy jeans wearing President. I just think it's just a matter of interpretation from the Japanese and SKorean's sides. I just think Pres. Obama is being neutral and just natural in abhorring comfort women issue as a form of degradation of women since they brand it as sexual slavery. But I just think he says to move on and meet halfway to resolve the historical issue. He's not really siding. Since as one poster said PM Abe's main agenda is the Senkakus which I think he won and not the comfort women issue. I applaud him for really knowing his priorities. Whereas in SKorea, they brought out the comfort women issue and Pres Obama of course responded as he did.  Nothing bad with his response, I think.  Only, the SKoreans overhyped the response of the US pres and claimed the US Pres is on their side which I think is not.
 
 @Hachikou, I partially agree with you! It is fact that innocent Chinese civilians were killed by ex-Japanese troop. But question is how many??
 
 1? 2 people? Chinese claims 300000people in Nankjin, which is impossible considering population there  at that time. Recently, Koreans found diray of the man working at comfort women facility. We are looking for that kind of evidence.
 
 Unfortunatly Korean says most of context is gone, so it doens'T show the evidence that Japanese forcing sex as a slave. ?This was a terrible, egregious violation of human rights. Those women were violated in ways that, even in the midst of war were shocking,?   Obama did an absolute right thing to speak for the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  Furthermore, Obama has every right to tell the world the simple fact, as a decent human being as well as a president represent the US: the sexual enslavement of women by Japanese imperial force brutally violated those victims? basic rights,  in any occasions he sees fit.  (it's not up to Japan's approval.) Japanese govt should recognize Japan's horrendous wartime crimes committed to humanity, and stop manipulating and whitewashing the facts. The more Japan wants to hide the truth; the worse the Japan?s public image is portrayed in the world community.  It is sample like that, but Abe & Co. still don't get it.

I'm interested to hear why it's counter-productive.  The way I see it; The 'comfort women; issues is the main cause of poor relations between Japan and Korea. America desperately wants its closest Asian allies to get on - so he wants to encourage Japan to be more pro-active with demonstrating greater remorse and atonement and Korea to be less emotional and more flexible.  How do you see it? Ilgoo, Counter-productive because the REAL issue which is supposed to be the one on the topic table is weathered by South Korea's manipulations to divert and mislead everyone away from the Takeshima/Dokdo dispute.That's the real cause of poor relationship between Japan and RoK. The whole comfort women issue is all but cover-ups! Did you heard anything from Mr.Obama about the Island? None! Japan wants to settle it through the ICJ but RoK refused. Instead RoK uses propaganda about Comfort Women. hachikouAPR. 26, 2014 - 10:20PM JST

   You see, this is Exactly what I am talking about. Your logic is groundless. Instead of showing evidence , your logic is just ""everybody says blah bla blah"".
 
   Was any of UN member there at that facility during WW2? Name the witness! Show us the link. I would love to hear it. Originally Confort woman issue started from Japan not korea. Japan has been studied extensively including testimony and interview, whole nation wide debate had already done. Take a look at wikipedia. You will see the whole list of references and source of information.
 
   Recently, Koreans found diray of the man working at comfort women facility. We are looking for that kind of evidence.

They weren't, they were far worse.  What you and many Japanese fail to accept is that Japan committed the most heinous and inhumane war crimes above and beyond those of any other nation (and not terribly far from those of Germany).
 
 You cannot go on denying the Nanking massacre, the death railway, comfort women and torture and starvation of thousands of POW's in countries throughout Asia were fabrications.  Japan, stand up, face the facts, bow humbly express genuine regret and never forget. 
 
 Then, finally, we can all move on. Do nothing and Japan's isolation will only deepen. Katsunobu Kato, deputy chief cabinet secretary, said Japan was aware of the suffering of the victims and was trying to avoid politicizing the emotional issue. Hypocrites.  Then how come the General Counsel from the Japanese Embassy in New York went to Palisades Park in New Jersey to meet with the town council there to try to prevail on them to take down their monument remembering the Korean sex slaves?  Guess it can only be ""politicized"" when it is Japan doing it. @letsberealistic, Japan's isolation will deepen? Isolation in what sense? How many times Jpolitician would vow down? It would never really end simply because they want a slice of Japan not just expression of remorse. I still stand with my belief that those women discovered prostitution as a way of survival during the war. For nowhere else could you find plenty of provisions other than the military camps during war. And those very same obaachans re-discovered that by wailing about how they were ""forced"" to prostitute themselves during war, could make their remaining life comfortable . titaniumdioxideAPR. 26, 2014 - 10:39PM JST

Worse than two atomic bombs? Worse than Mao's greatest slaughter of millions of Chinese? Your definition of the word ""worse"" is subjective and is limited to yourself. You always talk about facts and Mr.hachikou is providing you one but you fail to acknowledge a single. Not very realistic! The real problem is Japanese think the  biggest mistake they regretted is they failed to win the WWII. Unrealistic BS! Worse than two atomic bombs? Worse than Mao's greatest slaughter of millions of Chinese? Your definition of the word ""worse"" is subjective and is limited to yourself. You always talk about facts and Mr.hachikou is providing you one but you fail to acknowledge a single. Not very realistic! Atomic bombing was a horrible act, brought on by a desperate US that could see Japan would fight until all were dead anyway - a horrible decision that some same had to be made, some say didn't. Maos' massacres were truly horrible and yes on a par, with Nanking and other Japanese massacres, but not, you did not happen during WW2 and were not committed by an invasionary foreign force but by their own people.  So, do you have anything on a par with what Japan did, during the war, that was not a desperate measure to end the war that seemed endless? I agree that Obama has done a bit of a snake act by waiting until he get to Korea to bring up this topic, but his Japan visit was more about socializing than discussing the issues at hand. There were no resolutions to the TPP or security and occupation by US troops. It was all beer and prawns! (Sake and sushi) - Obama's timing may not be great, but his point is relevant and must be addressed. I can just imagine Abe sitting back with his ten dollar sake saying, ""WTF? I thought we were best buddies!"" Pretty much what I thought would happen.  The US should not get involved unless it is prepared to mediate at a summit. Statements like this will only further highlight South Korea's and Japan's differences. A letter from the emperor
 
  Then some right-wing politician will say the Emperor was forced to write the letter and South Korea will reset relations to square 1 again. South Korea needs to say exactly what will put this issue permanently to bed. After that no whining about individual politicians saying X or doing Y. a law to ban denying comfort women! I disagree. No country should have laws on historical (re)interpretation. It is for academics to decide on history, not politicians. In Germany denying the Holocaust is a prosecutable crime.  Japan cannot claim a special dispensation, not with that giant precedent in effect for decades. ""Most historians"" ... is one of the most meaningless and overused memes in this debate. Most people cannot tell the difference between ""historians"" and ""war time propagandists"" past and current. Life is not a football game. I don't think like a nationalist. I don't own any people, they are not ""my people"". No Japanese alive today is guilty, nor needs to bear any guilt or shame for any action they did not carry out.  That is logical and that is the law.  They are no more or less guilty for others actions than you are. This is all a propaganda war. Elements within China, Korea, the USA wish to bow, damage or break today's Japanese, and damage public support for them abroad, e.g. in the USA. Many of those elements are government sponsored, they are encouraging a ripple of support amongst race haters. What a way to earn a living, or spend your life ... It and the conflict and hatred it encourages, is nothing more than a deluded and toxic mental pollution. There is always a price to pay, G7 group of nations agreed today to impose further sanctions on The Russia Federation, so that basically adds Japan to whatever ""significant impact"" these sanctions will take to stop Moscow backed pro-Russian separatist violence in eastern Ukraine. Also this morning pro-Russian separatists in Slavyansk are reportedly holding 13 Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe observers hostage. President Obama is requesting support for 2nd and 3rd stage sanctions, and EU governments are reticent, with Germany particularly resistant, if further UN resolutions are needed, then support in the shape of a positive vote, will be expected in return. Yes, that has be proven time and time again by studying the details and the provenance of the originals ... That was one of the issue with Iris Chang's campaign. It was shown to her and her publishers that a number of images were well known fabrication or falsely attributed and they refused to remove them. Punishment like stripping the flesh off things are not traditional Japanese punishments, which generally depended more on humiliation rather capital punishment. I am not a denier, I just get sick of these people peddling their nonsense generation after generation. That's why I just call them ""atrocity pornographers"".  There is no morality to their position, they just enjoy looking at and showing each other nasty pictures and calling girls bad names.  (*A simple truth folks,  More than 53% of Japanese are women and never had any part in anything you accuse, neither did the children who were made victims too, neither did the farmer who stayed at home and farmed, neither did the workers, neither even did the Navy or much of the army ... by the time you logically work out who might have been involved, it is down to a single % of the population,  less the a similar amount of criminals in any society, and a hell of a lot less than most societies*). After the war, the Germans and Japanese had a different reaction to their bad behavior during the war. Most of the Germans were remorseful and guilt ridden. The Japanese immediately tried to rewrite history, and are still at it. Within days of Japan's surrender in 1945, coded messages went out from Tokyo to Japanese diplomats around the world, ordering them to start a campaign portraying Japan as a victim in the war, and to play down Japanese atrocities and play up Japanese civilian losses in the recent atomic bomb attacks. What was not so secret were Japanese efforts to ignore the war and portray themselves as victims. Many Japanese opposed rewriting history, which was often quite blatant. This meddling with historical facts regularly caused problems with neighbors, especially Korea and China. But the Japanese were insistent on evading responsibility. They still are, and many Japanese really believe it. what South Korea failed to tell Obama is that they 1965 Treaty resolved all issues during Japan's Colonization of Korea, and Japan's past apologies.  Double Jeopardy? Japan has done that, yet Korea still plays the victim card, which it no longer is.  Korea have no shame. I agree with Obama, and I disagree with Japan -- it is a diplomatic topic.

They still are, and many Japanese really believe it. This is the crux of the problem and the reason why these Asian countries cannot move forward. Because the Japanese feel like they were the main victims of the war, it keeps throwing a sharp knife in the sides of the countries that were brutalized under the Japanse and this is the fundamental problem why the other countries equally will never let it rest. Compensation, smiles and handshakes are not enough. Had Germany gone the same route as Japan did, Europe would be a very different place today. Go to Germany and ask the average German about the war. Most Getmans think that part of their history was the worst and should never be repeated again. Everything was based on lies and they are ashamed of it. On the flip side, the Japanese think differently and for some reason it's everyone else's fault except Japan's. Had Japan gone the same route ad Germany, the relationship between Japan and Asia would have made this entire continent a mega powerhouse, stronger, wealthier, unstoppable.be that as it is Japan and this topic with its neighbors will never be resolved as long as Japan and it's sympathizers dig in their heels and play the card of victimization.

Well the data tells us two different stories. less than 4% The Nottingham experience tells us that where opportunities are created and barriers to study abroad reduced, students do travel overseas for educational opportunities. About 23% of our undergraduate students spend some time overseas as part of their degree and we expect to reach our target of 25% of students undertaking an international experience as part of their degree by next year. Despite our successes, we still have a lot to do to reduce barriers further, including the bureaucratic hurdles around matching term dates, grade conversion and student housing arrangements, and the complacency and risk aversion among some students (as well as some academics). the standard ?9,000 tuition fee is reduced to just ?1,350 ?275 and  ?375 But, as the British Council report indicates, UK students are already studying overseas for all of their degree as an alternative to studying in the UK. report published for BIS Unless a student is on a ""full-ride"" scholarship package at a US university, they're going to have to find the full cost of tuition and living expenses upfront. Unless UK student loans are made available for study overseas, as is the case for American financial aid, studying an entire degree abroad will be limited to very well-off, the super bright or those showing the kind of sporting prowess valued by US universities. While the opportunities for full degree study overseas are becoming more prominent, the number of students able to undertake full degree study in another country will be limited unless the government allows student loans to be used internationally. Studying abroad as part of a UK degree is a great alternative that gives students the advantages of an educational experience overseas without some of the complications of diploma mobility. Universities in the UK need to do much more to meet the growing demand for an international experience by developing more exchange opportunities and thinking about what more can be done at home to take advantage of the highly international populations already on our campuses.

Well the data tells us two different stories. less than 4% The Nottingham experience tells us that where opportunities are created and barriers to study abroad reduced, students do travel overseas for educational opportunities. About 23% of our undergraduate students spend some time overseas as part of their degree and we expect to reach our target of 25% of students undertaking an international experience as part of their degree by next year. Despite our successes, we still have a lot to do to reduce barriers further, including the bureaucratic hurdles around matching term dates, grade conversion and student housing arrangements, and the complacency and risk aversion among some students (as well as some academics). the standard ?9,000 tuition fee is reduced to just ?1,350 ?275 and  ?375 But, as the British Council report indicates, UK students are already studying overseas for all of their degree as an alternative to studying in the UK. report published for BIS Unless a student is on a ""full-ride"" scholarship package at a US university, they're going to have to find the full cost of tuition and living expenses upfront. Unless UK student loans are made available for study overseas, as is the case for American financial aid, studying an entire degree abroad will be limited to very well-off, the super bright or those showing the kind of sporting prowess valued by US universities. While the opportunities for full degree study overseas are becoming more prominent, the number of students able to undertake full degree study in another country will be limited unless the government allows student loans to be used internationally. Studying abroad as part of a UK degree is a great alternative that gives students the advantages of an educational experience overseas without some of the complications of diploma mobility. Universities in the UK need to do much more to meet the growing demand for an international experience by developing more exchange opportunities and thinking about what more can be done at home to take advantage of the highly international populations already on our campuses.

 		About the Program Tomorrow's world will have borders, but fewer boundaries. Global forces are shaping rich and poor societies alike. Sophisticated technologies are changing the way we make, trade, and even grow things, and the way we act and interact as consumers, citizens, and life-long learners. Vast global telecommunications networks alert us of new crises and new opportunities almost immediately. These political, social and economic forces of globalization are transforming cultures around the world -- especially our own. The International Studies program brings together undergraduate students from a variety of disciplines who share an interest in global issues, politics, and events. International Studies students engage in a two-year journey shaped by multicultural and multidisciplinary living and learning, extensive exposure to global experts from on and off campus, trips to embassies, museums, and international organizations. As part of the International Studies Program, we also encourage students to partake in the variety of international events that occur on campus and off-campus, such as the Model United Nations and Model Organization of American States experiential simulations, and visits to embassies in Washington, D.C. The International Studies program is founded upon the belief that understanding political structures, forces, and processes is crucial to interpreting international relations and global events. Accordingly, our curriculum places importance on key concepts and theories used by political scientists to discuss events and trends at the international level. Of course, today's complex and interdependent world means that we must not limit our understanding of international studies to politics alone. The relationships among the world's governments must be viewed in connection with other actors, with socio-economic and cultural structures, and with historical and geographical influences. Therefore, the International Studies curriculum is inter-disciplinary and suitable for all undergraduate majors. We structure our courses to encourage critical thinking at various levels of analysis through different formats in colloquium, such as films, guest speakers, and small group discussions, developing students into dynamic global thinkers.

June 27, 2012 at 3:52 pm July 5, 2012 at 5:45 am Hearing most people here wallow in their pains of pursuit for education that their dreams are depended upon reminds me of my own past ed-fin-trap that i was in when i had lost my husband in a car accident in South Africa while we were living there, i had all the family burdens of responsibility hitched on my shoulders and even though i work at Singaporean embassy in Pretoria then didn?t make a different both in my financial needs and the pains i had to go through, as in one hand i needed emotional healing and relief and on the other all i needed was the financial boost to take care of my two children who were in the Pretoria University so that their education are not short lived but my embassy only decided to transfer me to Singapore embassy in New Zealand to help me get over the trauma of my late husband but could not help me with the most vital financial resources. As i turned to Junk Mail got some of my properties advertised, a buyer who came to buy some of my household items said ?madam don?t you think you will need this for your kids your said to be leaving behind, yes they will need it but at the moment whats more vital is their financials, as i yelled out that word unknowingly, the man bought what he could but as he was about to go he said to me, i wish i could help you and left. Two days later he rang me up and said ?Madam you said as you work at the Singapore embassy can you try this Scholarship Charity (www.globalscholarshipzzn.wix.com/globalscholarshipzzn) they are helping Asians, may you never know, i thanked him and boom i went to my computer though slightly discouraged looking at their funny website address, but when i looked them up and read their history and discovered why their site name look funny (Jewish community with love of money but hate lavish spending). I followed up their scholarship eligibility and applied for my two kids and when the draw award came out my daughter who was in her third year Micro Biology at University of Cape Town failed the award but my son who just graduated from Matric in 2009 worn the award and the award presentation took place in Singapore 15th July 2010, scholarship award certificate was received and in two days my son?s first year cash of $10,000 was wired into my account, even though my son?s tuition fee was far below that amount but it also helped with my daughter and other issues. My son worked hard and scored their average score marks and last year received his 2011 scholarship amount of $10,000 again.

Yes, I would like to receive news alerts from JapanToday Terms of Service Japan says sex slave issue not a diplomatic topic after Obama comments Japan warned the issue of its wartime system of sex slavery was not a ?diplomatic? subject, after U.S. President Barack Obama on Friday called it a ?terrible? violation of human rights. Katsunobu Kato, deputy chief cabinet secretary, said Japan was aware of the suffering of the victims and was trying to avoid politicizing the emotional issue. ?Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said he is deeply pained to think of the people who experienced immeasurable pain and suffering,? Kato said in a television program. ?This issue should not be made into a political or diplomatic subject,? he said. In a press conference in South Korea Friday, Obama called for an accounting of the wrongs perpetrated by Japanese troops before and during World War II when thousands of women were forced into prostitution, many from the Korean peninsula. ?This was a terrible, egregious violation of human rights. Those women were violated in ways that, even in the midst of war were shocking,? Obama said. But the U.S. president also pressed Tokyo and Seoul to look to the future. ?It is in the interests of both Japan and the Korean people to look forwards as well as backwards and to find ways in which the heartache and the pain of the past can be resolved,? Obama said. Washington finds it frustrating that its two major allies in the region are unable to resolve their issues and work together on other pressing issues, such as an increasingly strident China and Pyongyang?s nuclear weapons program. Despite formal apologies issued by the Japanese government, South Korea accuses Tokyo of failing sufficiently to atone for the ?comfort women?, who were pressed to service its troops during its brutal war of expansion. Japan previously used a quasi-public fund to give compensation accompanied by a letter of apology from the prime minister. But Japan has long maintained that the two nations have resolved reparation issues from the World War II by signing treaties. Japanese media said Obama was trying to urge both Tokyo and Seoul to stabilize their working relationship. Obama was calling on Japan to take proactive stance on the comfort women issue, while also pressing Seoul to overcome emotional reaction, the liberal Tokyo Shimbun said in an analysis. The influential Asahi Shimbun said South Korea might heighten pressure on Tokyo to address the comfort women issue after the Obama remark. But the daily also said a piece of American advice was also directed at South Korea. ?Obama is seen calling on South Korea to become more flexible because the future-oriented cooperation between Japan and South Korea has not been able to move forward as South Korea strongly remains hung up on the past history,? the Asahi said.
 
  Back to top Back to top Order by Time Order by Popularity Login to comment Login to comment Wow, impressive to see Japan standing up for themselves this way. It's about time. When you play the door mat diplomatically with westerners it will not work out for you, you have to show some back bone. Japan warned the issue of its wartime system of sex slavery was not a ?diplomatic? subject Of course it is, not only in the eyes of the US and South Korea as illustrated here, but also the dozens of other countries from whom women were taken and used as sex slaves by the IJA. It doesn't matter whether Japan likes this or not - it's just fact. So, Japan should stick by it's apology and never allow statements to be made by any officials that undermine the merits of the apology to the broader international community. These things should be sacrosanct and never tinkered with under any circumstances. I've said before that people will forgive providing they feel as though there is genuine contrition expressed. But they won't forget, and they certainly won't just sit idly by to let Japan try to revise it's history. President Obama is not man of his word, untrustworthy, a political opportunist, telling Heads of State and Government what they want to hear. This is President Obama political back to the future, for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, it's Senkaku Islands and security issues, for South Korean President Park Geun-Hye it comfort women and sex slaves. Pure and shameless opportunism, propagating a false empathy to garner future support, seemingly unbiased, but deliberately manipulative.  Chief Cabinet Secretary Y?hei K?no statement is equivocal: ""Undeniably, this was an act, with the involvement of the military authorities of the day, that severely injured the honour and dignity of many women. The Government of Japan would like to take this opportunity once again to extend its sincere apologies and remorse to all those, irrespective of place of origin, who suffered immeasurable pain and incurable physical and psychological wounds as comfort women""...... August 4, 1993 President Obama failed to draw on this statement choosing instead to grandstand to the populists.   President Obama's imminent visit to the Philippines, and the announcement of a new U.S. Philippine alliance agreement so allowing U.S. forces to return to the Philippines more than two decades after the US forces withdrew could indicate the US government current agenda. Japanese were all in love with Obama, until he said something they didn't like.
 
 Japanese were all in love with Caroline Kennedy, until she said something they didn't like.
 
 Japanese were all in love with Clinton, until she said something they didn't like.
 
 Japanese were all in love with Park, until she said something they didn't like. When will Japan learn that having good relations does not mean agreeing on everything and always being 'nice'.
 
 Time for Japan to wake up to the realities of international relations, or become isolated like North Korea. Yes, today Japan is a peaceful nation who offers a lot of aid, but the international community agrees Japan should do more to show a genuine attitude of remorse for its actions during the war. well said Obama. we in Indonesia have bad history by japan too, thou we not care anymore as we feel they are peace. But when they dont admit and try to revise (if there is), it opens the crack back.  it doesnt same for everyone. And the best to move is to recognize their own history and dared to faced it..
 
 If America just sided with Japan, it'll look bad for others..Some right wing japanese might never understood, just try to view history book of other nation, even in indonesia and what it means to us...We today not live in faction community, but openly connected world..America has to remain true to peace order of all nations, not just japan and represent the voice of others too This is not a political issue. It is a moral issue! Everybody knows there are no morals in politics! Let the next round of (never ending) white washing of what Japan did or didn't do in regards to comfort women issue begin. Sounds like the Japanese media is generally not critical of Obama's speech then, especially the more liberal ones. 
 
 Japan needs to be more ""pro-active"" (in other words do more) about the lack of atonement for comfort women, and S. Korea needs to be more flexible and less emotional. Sounds perfectly fair -  Come on Japan be the adult in this relationship and make a step. A letter from the emperor, or better yet, a law to ban denying comfort women! Then all this would be over in day! A letter from the emperor a law to ban denying comfort women! I disagree. No country should have laws on historical (re)interpretation. It is for academics to decide on history, not politicians. GalapagosnoGairaishuAPR. 26, 2014 - 06:06PM JST
 
 Obama dined on 30,000-yen sushi and then on his way out left behind a tur*d on Japan's doorstep. What a shocking lack of common sense. No, what he left was a dose of reality medicine. His views reflect the international community - there is a growing attitude of revisionism and denial in Japan and if it continues Japan will become increasingly isolated. I disagree. No country should have laws on historical (re)interpretation. It is for academics to decide on history, not politicians. Then tell that to Japanese politicians. They are constantly giving their own versions of history which do not agree with the majority. Make it law and you don't have the problem of revisionism. Igloobuyer@Smart diplomacy is the art of knowing when to keep one's mouth shut. If Obama had intended to lecture the Japanese on the errors of their ways, he should have done it to their faces, and not across the ""East Sea."" Barack Obama has warned North Korea over nuclear testing, there are clear indications this is the fourth nuclear test, there needs to be complete unity between all governments.  Hardly a word has been muttered unless it a insult, how does stating the obvious, in such a manner, bring forth a harmonious response? GalapagosnoGairaishuAPR. 26, 2014 - 06:25PM JST
 
   Igloobuyer@Smart diplomacy is the art of knowing when to keep one's mouth shut. If Obama had intended to lecture the Japanese on the errors of their ways, he should have done it to their faces, and not across the ""East Sea."" I see no lecturing in his statement. He just said Japan needs to be more pro-active and Korea needs to be less emotional. Now do you know he didn't bring it up with Abe anyway? This is one of the issues contributing to the current diplomatic rift. Of course it's a ""diplomatic topic."" Gimme a break. Now do you know he didn't bring it up with Abe anyway? Well letsbe@ Isn't that the whole point here? Whatever Obama and Abe discussed was carefully vetted by their handlers before served for public consumption. In Korean the finger-wagging was done at a televised press conference. I bet you a kilo of kimchi that no Korean will escape the impression that Obama has taken their country's side in this particular dispute. Crimson and Clover Germany never would have responded this way. And that folks explains why Germany does not get treated this way anymore. The only explanation I have for why Japan insists on shooting itself in the foot is a traditional inexperience with dealing with the rest of the world.   It takes a serious navel gazer to not understand where this reaction is going to go after the hundredth time of the same reaction. Our president is a true diplomatic fool!!! Real stupidity is the only thing that I can think of that would lead him bring up this issue. Why blame the present day government of Japan for something that took place during WWII? How many times do the world have to tell you? ""Comfort woman was NOT sex slave but prostetutes. THere is a lot of evidence or documents for that.""
 
 ""THere is NO evidece existing that ex-Japanese troop force these woman to have sex in organized manner, while there is an evidence of ex-japanese troop that issued to prohibit its army or locala bases from forcing these women to have sex"" Evdence is the only way to show what really happened. Did Obama make the statement about comfort women in Japan, South Korea, or in both countries? If he did not say it while in Japan then why say it at all? In South Korea he is just singing to the choir. I wud bet some ca$h that Obama DID mention the sex slave issue, IN PRIVATE, hoping Japan would man up & take responsibility, PUBLICLY..................but alas once again we see Japan likes to take the low road, she will never learn by the looks of it & continues to reap what she has sewn for many many decades & STILL counting hachikouAPR. 26, 2014 - 09:03PM JST

   ""Comfort woman was NOT sex slave but prostetutes. THere is a lot of evidence or documents for that."" ""THere is NO evidece existing that ex-Japanese troop force these woman to have sex in organized manner, while there is an evidence of ex-japanese troop that issued to prohibit its army or locala bases from forcing these women to have sex""
 
   Evdence is the only way to show what really happened. Sure, and there was no Nanking massacre, no 'death railway', no torture and starvation of POW's, yes, Japan liberated Asia from the oppressive Western colonialists. You go ahead and believe what you want to believe, and the world will go on and believe what overwhelming evidence shows and never the twain shall meet. So everyone trashed Abe for running everything by visiting Yasukuni.
 
 So what do we call Obama who has been working to resolve SK-JPN tensions for the sake
 
 of US regional strategic policy, even reaching a point where both countries are prepared to discuss
 
 the issue together, and he comes out with this utterly stupid counter productive comment? Hachikou >How many times do the world have to tell you? What planet are you living on? UN and rest of the world acknowledge that the Japanese army forced these young women into sexual slaves. It's not only Korea. Wormen but Chinese, Taiwanese, Dutch, and etc. UN report clearly states up to 200,000 women forced into sexual slavery. So stop pretending to deny this fact. Absolutelt agree with subyyaki. Japan shows more backbone compared to my mommy jeans wearing President. I just think it's just a matter of interpretation from the Japanese and SKorean's sides. I just think Pres. Obama is being neutral and just natural in abhorring comfort women issue as a form of degradation of women since they brand it as sexual slavery. But I just think he says to move on and meet halfway to resolve the historical issue. He's not really siding. Since as one poster said PM Abe's main agenda is the Senkakus which I think he won and not the comfort women issue. I applaud him for really knowing his priorities. Whereas in SKorea, they brought out the comfort women issue and Pres Obama of course responded as he did.  Nothing bad with his response, I think.  Only, the SKoreans overhyped the response of the US pres and claimed the US Pres is on their side which I think is not.
 
 @Hachikou, I partially agree with you! It is fact that innocent Chinese civilians were killed by ex-Japanese troop. But question is how many??
 
 1? 2 people? Chinese claims 300000people in Nankjin, which is impossible considering population there  at that time. Recently, Koreans found diray of the man working at comfort women facility. We are looking for that kind of evidence.
 
 Unfortunatly Korean says most of context is gone, so it doens'T show the evidence that Japanese forcing sex as a slave. ?This was a terrible, egregious violation of human rights. Those women were violated in ways that, even in the midst of war were shocking,?   Obama did an absolute right thing to speak for the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  Furthermore, Obama has every right to tell the world the simple fact, as a decent human being as well as a president represent the US: the sexual enslavement of women by Japanese imperial force brutally violated those victims? basic rights,  in any occasions he sees fit.  (it's not up to Japan's approval.) Japanese govt should recognize Japan's horrendous wartime crimes committed to humanity, and stop manipulating and whitewashing the facts. The more Japan wants to hide the truth; the worse the Japan?s public image is portrayed in the world community.  It is sample like that, but Abe & Co. still don't get it.

I'm interested to hear why it's counter-productive.  The way I see it; The 'comfort women; issues is the main cause of poor relations between Japan and Korea. America desperately wants its closest Asian allies to get on - so he wants to encourage Japan to be more pro-active with demonstrating greater remorse and atonement and Korea to be less emotional and more flexible.  How do you see it? Ilgoo, Counter-productive because the REAL issue which is supposed to be the one on the topic table is weathered by South Korea's manipulations to divert and mislead everyone away from the Takeshima/Dokdo dispute.That's the real cause of poor relationship between Japan and RoK. The whole comfort women issue is all but cover-ups! Did you heard anything from Mr.Obama about the Island? None! Japan wants to settle it through the ICJ but RoK refused. Instead RoK uses propaganda about Comfort Women. hachikouAPR. 26, 2014 - 10:20PM JST

   You see, this is Exactly what I am talking about. Your logic is groundless. Instead of showing evidence , your logic is just ""everybody says blah bla blah"".
 
   Was any of UN member there at that facility during WW2? Name the witness! Show us the link. I would love to hear it. Originally Confort woman issue started from Japan not korea. Japan has been studied extensively including testimony and interview, whole nation wide debate had already done. Take a look at wikipedia. You will see the whole list of references and source of information.
 
   Recently, Koreans found diray of the man working at comfort women facility. We are looking for that kind of evidence. Unfortunatly Korean says most of context is gone, so it doens'T show the evidence that Japanese forcing sex as a slave. You want to believe that the Japanese military was no worse than any other. They weren't, they were far worse.  What you and many Japanese fail to accept is that Japan committed the most heinous and inhumane war crimes above and beyond those of any other nation (and not terribly far from those of Germany).
 
 You cannot go on denying the Nanking massacre, the death railway, comfort women and torture and starvation of thousands of POW's in countries throughout Asia were fabrications.  Japan, stand up, face the facts, bow humbly express genuine regret and never forget. 
 
 Then, finally, we can all move on. Do nothing and Japan's isolation will only deepen. Katsunobu Kato, deputy chief cabinet secretary, said Japan was aware of the suffering of the victims and was trying to avoid politicizing the emotional issue. Hypocrites.  Then how come the General Counsel from the Japanese Embassy in New York went to Palisades Park in New Jersey to meet with the town council there to try to prevail on them to take down their monument remembering the Korean sex slaves?  Guess it can only be ""politicized"" when it is Japan doing it. @letsberealistic, Japan's isolation will deepen? Isolation in what sense? How many times Jpolitician would vow down? It would never really end simply because they want a slice of Japan not just expression of remorse. I still stand with my belief that those women discovered prostitution as a way of survival during the war. For nowhere else could you find plenty of provisions other than the military camps during war. And those very same obaachans re-discovered that by wailing about how they were ""forced"" to prostitute themselves during war, could make their remaining life comfortable . titaniumdioxideAPR. 26, 2014 - 10:39PM JST

So, the comfort women issues is all just a 'cover up' a conspiracy to 'deflect' interest away from the 'real' issue of Takeshima/ Dokdo.

Worse than two atomic bombs? Worse than Mao's greatest slaughter of millions of Chinese? Your definition of the word ""worse"" is subjective and is limited to yourself. You always talk about facts and Mr.hachikou is providing you one but you fail to acknowledge a single. Not very realistic! The real problem is Japanese think the  biggest mistake they regretted is they failed to win the WWII. Unrealistic BS! Worse than two atomic bombs? Worse than Mao's greatest slaughter of millions of Chinese? Your definition of the word ""worse"" is subjective and is limited to yourself. You always talk about facts and Mr.hachikou is providing you one but you fail to acknowledge a single. Not very realistic! Atomic bombing was a horrible act, brought on by a desperate US that could see Japan would fight until all were dead anyway - a horrible decision that some same had to be made, some say didn't. Maos' massacres were truly horrible and yes on a par, with Nanking and other Japanese massacres, but not, you did not happen during WW2 and were not committed by an invasionary foreign force but by their own people.  So, do you have anything on a par with what Japan did, during the war, that was not a desperate measure to end the war that seemed endless? I agree that Obama has done a bit of a snake act by waiting until he get to Korea to bring up this topic, but his Japan visit was more about socializing than discussing the issues at hand. There were no resolutions to the TPP or security and occupation by US troops. It was all beer and prawns! (Sake and sushi) - Obama's timing may not be great, but his point is relevant and must be addressed. I can just imagine Abe sitting back with his ten dollar sake saying, ""WTF? I thought we were best buddies!"" Pretty much what I thought would happen.  The US should not get involved unless it is prepared to mediate at a summit. Statements like this will only further highlight South Korea's and Japan's differences. A letter from the emperor
 
  Then some right-wing politician will say the Emperor was forced to write the letter and South Korea will reset relations to square 1 again. South Korea needs to say exactly what will put this issue permanently to bed. After that no whining about individual politicians saying X or doing Y. a law to ban denying comfort women! I disagree. No country should have laws on historical (re)interpretation. It is for academics to decide on history, not politicians. In Germany denying the Holocaust is a prosecutable crime.  Japan cannot claim a special dispensation, not with that giant precedent in effect for decades. ""Most historians"" ... is one of the most meaningless and overused memes in this debate. Most people cannot tell the difference between ""historians"" and ""war time propagandists"" past and current. Life is not a football game. I don't think like a nationalist. I don't own any people, they are not ""my people"". No Japanese alive today is guilty, nor needs to bear any guilt or shame for any action they did not carry out.  That is logical and that is the law.  They are no more or less guilty for others actions than you are. This is all a propaganda war. Elements within China, Korea, the USA wish to bow, damage or break today's Japanese, and damage public support for them abroad, e.g. in the USA. Many of those elements are government sponsored, they are encouraging a ripple of support amongst race haters. What a way to earn a living, or spend your life ... It and the conflict and hatred it encourages, is nothing more than a deluded and toxic mental pollution. There is always a price to pay, G7 group of nations agreed today to impose further sanctions on The Russia Federation, so that basically adds Japan to whatever ""significant impact"" these sanctions will take to stop Moscow backed pro-Russian separatist violence in eastern Ukraine. Also this morning pro-Russian separatists in Slavyansk are reportedly holding 13 Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe observers hostage. President Obama is requesting support for 2nd and 3rd stage sanctions, and EU governments are reticent, with Germany particularly resistant, if further UN resolutions are needed, then support in the shape of a positive vote, will be expected in return. Yes, that has be proven time and time again by studying the details and the provenance of the originals ... That was one of the issue with Iris Chang's campaign. It was shown to her and her publishers that a number of images were well known fabrication or falsely attributed and they refused to remove them. Punishment like stripping the flesh off things are not traditional Japanese punishments, which generally depended more on humiliation rather capital punishment. I am not a denier, I just get sick of these people peddling their nonsense generation after generation. That's why I just call them ""atrocity pornographers"".  There is no morality to their position, they just enjoy looking at and showing each other nasty pictures and calling girls bad names.  (*A simple truth folks,  More than 53% of Japanese are women and never had any part in anything you accuse, neither did the children who were made victims too, neither did the farmer who stayed at home and farmed, neither did the workers, neither even did the Navy or much of the army ... by the time you logically work out who might have been involved, it is down to a single % of the population,  less the a similar amount of criminals in any society, and a hell of a lot less than most societies*). After the war, the Germans and Japanese had a different reaction to their bad behavior during the war. Most of the Germans were remorseful and guilt ridden. The Japanese immediately tried to rewrite history, and are still at it. Within days of Japan's surrender in 1945, coded messages went out from Tokyo to Japanese diplomats around the world, ordering them to start a campaign portraying Japan as a victim in the war, and to play down Japanese atrocities and play up Japanese civilian losses in the recent atomic bomb attacks. What was not so secret were Japanese efforts to ignore the war and portray themselves as victims. Many Japanese opposed rewriting history, which was often quite blatant. This meddling with historical facts regularly caused problems with neighbors, especially Korea and China. But the Japanese were insistent on evading responsibility. They still are, and many Japanese really believe it. what South Korea failed to tell Obama is that they 1965 Treaty resolved all issues during Japan's Colonization of Korea, and Japan's past apologies.  Double Jeopardy? Japan has done that, yet Korea still plays the victim card, which it no longer is.  Korea have no shame. I agree with Obama, and I disagree with Japan -- it is a diplomatic topic.

They still are, and many Japanese really believe it. This is the crux of the problem and the reason why these Asian countries cannot move forward. Because the Japanese feel like they were the main victims of the war, it keeps throwing a sharp knife in the sides of the countries that were brutalized under the Japanse and this is the fundamental problem why the other countries equally will never let it rest. Compensation, smiles and handshakes are not enough. Had Germany gone the same route as Japan did, Europe would be a very different place today. Go to Germany and ask the average German about the war. Most Getmans think that part of their history was the worst and should never be repeated again. Everything was based on lies and they are ashamed of it. On the flip side, the Japanese think differently and for some reason it's everyone else's fault except Japan's. Had Japan gone the same route ad Germany, the relationship between Japan and Asia would have made this entire continent a mega powerhouse, stronger, wealthier, unstoppable.be that as it is Japan and this topic with its neighbors will never be resolved as long as Japan and it's sympathizers dig in their heels and play the card of victimization.

 	The NCAA has its roots in the rough beginnings of American Football. It was President Roosevelt himself who took the first steps towards the reformation of the sport and the start of the NCAA. At a meeting of 13 institutions in 1905, he encouraged a concerted effort to make changes in the football playing rules to avoid the complete abolition of the sport at Collegiate level. This led to the formation of the Intercollegiate Athletics Association Of The United States (IAAUS) a short time later. The IAAUS was renamed the NCAA the following year and in 1921, it went beyond it?s discussion groups to hold it?s first NCAA national championship: The national collegiate track and field championship. 
 
 	In 1951, Walter Byers became the first salaried executive director in an effort to bring a professional voice to the association. 
 
 	The start of the 80?s led to the inclusion of women?s athletics and services. Nineteen championship events were established for the women?s program. 
 
 	Throughout it?s history, the NCAA has strived to control abuse of student athletes and improve intercollegiate programs. These efforts include establishing and maintaining standards for intercollegiate sports, developing educational leadership programs and promoting recreational participation in athletics. The Association also collects athletics records and statistics as well as formulating rules of play for intercollegiate athletics. 
 
 	One of the most important roles of the NCAA is to represent it?s members at the state and federal level, in matters ranging from federal aid to physical education and the televising of championships. 
 
 	As well as promoting their own championship events, the NCAA also helps in the planning and participation in international sports by being a member in various sporting bodies such as the U.S.Olympic Committee and the U.S. Collegiate Sports Council. 
 
 	For the athletes themselves, the NCAA provides valuable support both throughout their college years, and beyond into their professional careers. 
 
 	Last year the NCAA awarded more than $1million in scholarships. These are awarded to students who are involved in college athletics or related careers. There are three scholarships for postgraduate studies and two for undergraduates. 
 
 	Over 150 postgraduate scholarships are awarded annually to athletes who have excelled both in their sport and in their academic studies. 
 
 	The women?s enhancement program was established n the 1980?s and serves to enhance opportunities for women athletes at various levels. At the same time the NCAA Ethnic Minority Enhancement Program was formed to increase opportunities for minority candidates specialising in coaching and administrative positions in athletics. comments powered by Disqus.

         post graduate projects and study Postgraduate scholarships for study in Australia Generally, postgraduate courses are not Commonwealth supported; for domestic students (Australian and New Zealand citizens) and international students alike, they themselves are usually required to pay tuition fees. The cost of postgraduate studies varies greatly, depending on many factors including the establishment at which the course is to be conducted and the subject area. Scholarships for domestic students Scholarships for international students It is really important that you contact your (potential) higher education provider for information about how much you would expect to pay for a course leading to a postgraduate degree well in advance of making a formal application. There is no point wasting your time, or the time of the university or institute, applying for a place you may ultimately be unable to fund. On top of the course fees and other course related expenses (thesis binding for example), there will be living expenses to consider as well, such as rent, food, utilities, travel (running costs of a car and/or the use of public transport) and social activities. You may be fortunate enough to obtain a postgraduate position in your home town, where you can reside cheaply (even for free) with family, friends or a partner, but in most cases you will probably be looking at living independently and footing most or all of the living expenses yourself. If you are an international student, you may also want to factor in travel back and forth to your home country on occasion. PhDSeek.com cannot and does not provide any further assistance on an individual basis with regards to finding scholarships. If you are an international student, there may well be scholarships on offer by the government, institutes and universities in your own country. This is an avenue strongly recommended that you explore. On May 13th 2008, as part of the 2008/2009 budget, the Australian government announced they would be doubling the number of postgraduate scholarships available to higher degree research students by 2012. The Scholarships for a Competitive Future ? Postgraduate Scholarships initiative, will result in many more higher degree research students receiving support for their living costs while undertaking a research degree. The initiative will increase the total number of Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) holders from around 4,800 to nearly 10,000 by 2012. Below are some of the more commonly available scholarships for domestic and international students. This is by no means a complete list. New scholarships become available all of the time, sometimes on a recurring basis, sometimes just as one-offs. It is advisable to look for funding from any source available. For example, you may be able to find scholarships through companies (many large internationals offer scholarships as a way of giving back to society), universities in your home country (particularly when trying to develop international collaborations), the Australian mission in your home country, by searching the Internet and so forth. Scholarships for domestic students APA stipend rates for 2008 are $20,007 for full-time students and $10,710 for part-time students. The APA scholarship program is administered on behalf of the Australian Government by individual higher education providers. The providers are responsible for conducting their own application and selection procedures, in line with guidelines issued by the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (DEEWR). Potential applicants need to direct their enquiries on application procedures, deadlines and other issues to their higher education providers. APAI stipend rates for 2008 are: As supervisors need to have obtained the grant in advance of advertising the postgraduate course, a potential candidate would be applying for both the full package (so to speak) of candidature and scholarship. From 2009, two new scholarship categories will be introduced: Scholarships for international students International students are considered to be those who are not Australian & New Zealand citizens, or permanent Australian residents. leave a response 4 Responses to ?Postgraduate scholarships for study in Australia?

Well the data tells us two different stories. less than 4% The Nottingham experience tells us that where opportunities are created and barriers to study abroad reduced, students do travel overseas for educational opportunities. About 23% of our undergraduate students spend some time overseas as part of their degree and we expect to reach our target of 25% of students undertaking an international experience as part of their degree by next year. Despite our successes, we still have a lot to do to reduce barriers further, including the bureaucratic hurdles around matching term dates, grade conversion and student housing arrangements, and the complacency and risk aversion among some students (as well as some academics). the standard ?9,000 tuition fee is reduced to just ?1,350 ?275 and  ?375 But, as the British Council report indicates, UK students are already studying overseas for all of their degree as an alternative to studying in the UK. report published for BIS Unless a student is on a ""full-ride"" scholarship package at a US university, they're going to have to find the full cost of tuition and living expenses upfront. Unless UK student loans are made available for study overseas, as is the case for American financial aid, studying an entire degree abroad will be limited to very well-off, the super bright or those showing the kind of sporting prowess valued by US universities. While the opportunities for full degree study overseas are becoming more prominent, the number of students able to undertake full degree study in another country will be limited unless the government allows student loans to be used internationally. Studying abroad as part of a UK degree is a great alternative that gives students the advantages of an educational experience overseas without some of the complications of diploma mobility. Universities in the UK need to do much more to meet the growing demand for an international experience by developing more exchange opportunities and thinking about what more can be done at home to take advantage of the highly international populations already on our campuses.

Scholarships are offered by the Australian Government, education institutions and a number of other organisations. They cover various educational sectors, including vocational education and training, student exchanges, undergraduate and postgraduate study and research. Australian Government scholarships are not available for international students undertaking English language training specifically in Australia. However, there are several English language training scholarships offered by Australian institutions. The International Postgraduate Research Scholarships (IPRS) scheme enables eligible international students to undertake a postgraduate research qualification in Australia and gain experience with leading Australian researchers. The scholarship covers tuition fees and health cover costs for scholarship holders, and health cover costs for their dependants.

     financial aid available from US sources for international students. 
 
     International student scholarships are very hard to secure. The 
 
     great majority of international students in America must rely exclusively on 
 
     themselves and their relatives for funding. If you need to obtain financial 
 
     aid to afford an American education, the best place for you to look 
 
     is your home country. There may be scholarships and 
 
     loans available for study abroad 
 
     from your government, or from local businesses, organizations, and foundations in 
 
     your home country. Other places to look for 
 
     international student scholarships, loans and other 
 
     forms of aid are international humanitarian 
 
     organizations that want to promote international education and cultural 
 
     exchange with the USA. Included in these organizations are the United 
 
     Nations, the World Health Organization, the League of Red Cross Societies, 
 
     and the World Council of Churches. Some of these organizations have 
 
     restricted financial aid. For example, the international student 
 
     scholarships or aid may only be available to graduate students, students 
 
     from a specific ethnic group, or students who have chosen a specific course 
 
     of study. Financial aid and scholarships from these organizations are very 
 
     competitive, so you need to start your search early. Find a school near you Curriculum and Instruction Finally, there are also many universities in 
 
     the US that provide financial aid and scholarships to international students. However, this 
 
     aid is usually limited and is often more readily available to graduate than 
 
     undergraduate students. Furthermore, competition for international student 
 
     scholarships and aid is fierce, and 
 
     schools are careful to help out the most deserving students. 
 
     Good grades and exam scores are extremely important in securing a 
 
     scholarship. Find out whether any of the schools that you would 
 
     like to apply to have grants, loans or scholarships for international students. If they 
 
     don't, and you have not been able to obtain enough funding on your own, you 
 
     may have to consider other schools that will help. Below are some links for websites that 
 
     provide information on scholarships and financial aid for

Yes, I would like to receive news alerts from JapanToday Terms of Service Japan says sex slave issue not a diplomatic topic after Obama comments Japan warned the issue of its wartime system of sex slavery was not a ?diplomatic? subject, after U.S. President Barack Obama on Friday called it a ?terrible? violation of human rights. Katsunobu Kato, deputy chief cabinet secretary, said Japan was aware of the suffering of the victims and was trying to avoid politicizing the emotional issue. ?Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said he is deeply pained to think of the people who experienced immeasurable pain and suffering,? Kato said in a television program. ?This issue should not be made into a political or diplomatic subject,? he said. In a press conference in South Korea Friday, Obama called for an accounting of the wrongs perpetrated by Japanese troops before and during World War II when thousands of women were forced into prostitution, many from the Korean peninsula. ?This was a terrible, egregious violation of human rights. Those women were violated in ways that, even in the midst of war were shocking,? Obama said. But the U.S. president also pressed Tokyo and Seoul to look to the future. ?It is in the interests of both Japan and the Korean people to look forwards as well as backwards and to find ways in which the heartache and the pain of the past can be resolved,? Obama said. Washington finds it frustrating that its two major allies in the region are unable to resolve their issues and work together on other pressing issues, such as an increasingly strident China and Pyongyang?s nuclear weapons program. Despite formal apologies issued by the Japanese government, South Korea accuses Tokyo of failing sufficiently to atone for the ?comfort women?, who were pressed to service its troops during its brutal war of expansion. Japan previously used a quasi-public fund to give compensation accompanied by a letter of apology from the prime minister. But Japan has long maintained that the two nations have resolved reparation issues from the World War II by signing treaties. Japanese media said Obama was trying to urge both Tokyo and Seoul to stabilize their working relationship. Obama was calling on Japan to take proactive stance on the comfort women issue, while also pressing Seoul to overcome emotional reaction, the liberal Tokyo Shimbun said in an analysis. The influential Asahi Shimbun said South Korea might heighten pressure on Tokyo to address the comfort women issue after the Obama remark. But the daily also said a piece of American advice was also directed at South Korea. ?Obama is seen calling on South Korea to become more flexible because the future-oriented cooperation between Japan and South Korea has not been able to move forward as South Korea strongly remains hung up on the past history,? the Asahi said.
 
  Back to top Back to top Order by Time Order by Popularity Login to comment Login to comment Wow, impressive to see Japan standing up for themselves this way. It's about time. When you play the door mat diplomatically with westerners it will not work out for you, you have to show some back bone. Japan warned the issue of its wartime system of sex slavery was not a ?diplomatic? subject Of course it is, not only in the eyes of the US and South Korea as illustrated here, but also the dozens of other countries from whom women were taken and used as sex slaves by the IJA. It doesn't matter whether Japan likes this or not - it's just fact. So, Japan should stick by it's apology and never allow statements to be made by any officials that undermine the merits of the apology to the broader international community. These things should be sacrosanct and never tinkered with under any circumstances. I've said before that people will forgive providing they feel as though there is genuine contrition expressed. But they won't forget, and they certainly won't just sit idly by to let Japan try to revise it's history. President Obama is not man of his word, untrustworthy, a political opportunist, telling Heads of State and Government what they want to hear. This is President Obama political back to the future, for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, it's Senkaku Islands and security issues, for South Korean President Park Geun-Hye it comfort women and sex slaves. Pure and shameless opportunism, propagating a false empathy to garner future support, seemingly unbiased, but deliberately manipulative.  Chief Cabinet Secretary Y?hei K?no statement is equivocal: ""Undeniably, this was an act, with the involvement of the military authorities of the day, that severely injured the honour and dignity of many women. The Government of Japan would like to take this opportunity once again to extend its sincere apologies and remorse to all those, irrespective of place of origin, who suffered immeasurable pain and incurable physical and psychological wounds as comfort women""...... August 4, 1993 President Obama failed to draw on this statement choosing instead to grandstand to the populists.   President Obama's imminent visit to the Philippines, and the announcement of a new U.S. Philippine alliance agreement so allowing U.S. forces to return to the Philippines more than two decades after the US forces withdrew could indicate the US government current agenda. Japanese were all in love with Obama, until he said something they didn't like.
 
 Japanese were all in love with Caroline Kennedy, until she said something they didn't like.
 
 Japanese were all in love with Clinton, until she said something they didn't like.
 
 Japanese were all in love with Park, until she said something they didn't like. When will Japan learn that having good relations does not mean agreeing on everything and always being 'nice'.
 
 Time for Japan to wake up to the realities of international relations, or become isolated like North Korea. Yes, today Japan is a peaceful nation who offers a lot of aid, but the international community agrees Japan should do more to show a genuine attitude of remorse for its actions during the war. well said Obama. we in Indonesia have bad history by japan too, thou we not care anymore as we feel they are peace. But when they dont admit and try to revise (if there is), it opens the crack back.  it doesnt same for everyone. And the best to move is to recognize their own history and dared to faced it..
 
 If America just sided with Japan, it'll look bad for others..Some right wing japanese might never understood, just try to view history book of other nation, even in indonesia and what it means to us...We today not live in faction community, but openly connected world..America has to remain true to peace order of all nations, not just japan and represent the voice of others too This is not a political issue. It is a moral issue! Everybody knows there are no morals in politics! Let the next round of (never ending) white washing of what Japan did or didn't do in regards to comfort women issue begin. Sounds like the Japanese media is generally not critical of Obama's speech then, especially the more liberal ones. 
 
 Japan needs to be more ""pro-active"" (in other words do more) about the lack of atonement for comfort women, and S. Korea needs to be more flexible and less emotional. Sounds perfectly fair -  Come on Japan be the adult in this relationship and make a step. A letter from the emperor, or better yet, a law to ban denying comfort women! Then all this would be over in day! A letter from the emperor a law to ban denying comfort women! I disagree. No country should have laws on historical (re)interpretation. It is for academics to decide on history, not politicians. GalapagosnoGairaishuAPR. 26, 2014 - 06:06PM JST
 
 Obama dined on 30,000-yen sushi and then on his way out left behind a tur*d on Japan's doorstep. What a shocking lack of common sense. No, what he left was a dose of reality medicine. His views reflect the international community - there is a growing attitude of revisionism and denial in Japan and if it continues Japan will become increasingly isolated. I disagree. No country should have laws on historical (re)interpretation. It is for academics to decide on history, not politicians. Then tell that to Japanese politicians. They are constantly giving their own versions of history which do not agree with the majority. Make it law and you don't have the problem of revisionism. Igloobuyer@Smart diplomacy is the art of knowing when to keep one's mouth shut. If Obama had intended to lecture the Japanese on the errors of their ways, he should have done it to their faces, and not across the ""East Sea."" Barack Obama has warned North Korea over nuclear testing, there are clear indications this is the fourth nuclear test, there needs to be complete unity between all governments.  Hardly a word has been muttered unless it a insult, how does stating the obvious, in such a manner, bring forth a harmonious response? GalapagosnoGairaishuAPR. 26, 2014 - 06:25PM JST
 
   Igloobuyer@Smart diplomacy is the art of knowing when to keep one's mouth shut. If Obama had intended to lecture the Japanese on the errors of their ways, he should have done it to their faces, and not across the ""East Sea."" I see no lecturing in his statement. He just said Japan needs to be more pro-active and Korea needs to be less emotional. Now do you know he didn't bring it up with Abe anyway? This is one of the issues contributing to the current diplomatic rift. Of course it's a ""diplomatic topic."" Gimme a break. Now do you know he didn't bring it up with Abe anyway? Well letsbe@ Isn't that the whole point here? Whatever Obama and Abe discussed was carefully vetted by their handlers before served for public consumption. In Korean the finger-wagging was done at a televised press conference. I bet you a kilo of kimchi that no Korean will escape the impression that Obama has taken their country's side in this particular dispute. Crimson and Clover Germany never would have responded this way. And that folks explains why Germany does not get treated this way anymore. The only explanation I have for why Japan insists on shooting itself in the foot is a traditional inexperience with dealing with the rest of the world.   It takes a serious navel gazer to not understand where this reaction is going to go after the hundredth time of the same reaction. Our president is a true diplomatic fool!!! Real stupidity is the only thing that I can think of that would lead him bring up this issue. Why blame the present day government of Japan for something that took place during WWII? How many times do the world have to tell you? ""Comfort woman was NOT sex slave but prostetutes. THere is a lot of evidence or documents for that.""
 
 ""THere is NO evidece existing that ex-Japanese troop force these woman to have sex in organized manner, while there is an evidence of ex-japanese troop that issued to prohibit its army or locala bases from forcing these women to have sex"" Evdence is the only way to show what really happened. Did Obama make the statement about comfort women in Japan, South Korea, or in both countries? If he did not say it while in Japan then why say it at all? In South Korea he is just singing to the choir. I wud bet some ca$h that Obama DID mention the sex slave issue, IN PRIVATE, hoping Japan would man up & take responsibility, PUBLICLY..................but alas once again we see Japan likes to take the low road, she will never learn by the looks of it & continues to reap what she has sewn for many many decades & STILL counting hachikouAPR. 26, 2014 - 09:03PM JST

   ""Comfort woman was NOT sex slave but prostetutes. THere is a lot of evidence or documents for that."" ""THere is NO evidece existing that ex-Japanese troop force these woman to have sex in organized manner, while there is an evidence of ex-japanese troop that issued to prohibit its army or locala bases from forcing these women to have sex""
 
   Evdence is the only way to show what really happened. Sure, and there was no Nanking massacre, no 'death railway', no torture and starvation of POW's, yes, Japan liberated Asia from the oppressive Western colonialists. You go ahead and believe what you want to believe, and the world will go on and believe what overwhelming evidence shows and never the twain shall meet. So everyone trashed Abe for running everything by visiting Yasukuni.
 
 So what do we call Obama who has been working to resolve SK-JPN tensions for the sake
 
 of US regional strategic policy, even reaching a point where both countries are prepared to discuss
 
 the issue together, and he comes out with this utterly stupid counter productive comment? Hachikou >How many times do the world have to tell you? What planet are you living on? UN and rest of the world acknowledge that the Japanese army forced these young women into sexual slaves. It's not only Korea. Wormen but Chinese, Taiwanese, Dutch, and etc. UN report clearly states up to 200,000 women forced into sexual slavery. So stop pretending to deny this fact. Absolutelt agree with subyyaki. Japan shows more backbone compared to my mommy jeans wearing President. I just think it's just a matter of interpretation from the Japanese and SKorean's sides. I just think Pres. Obama is being neutral and just natural in abhorring comfort women issue as a form of degradation of women since they brand it as sexual slavery. But I just think he says to move on and meet halfway to resolve the historical issue. He's not really siding. Since as one poster said PM Abe's main agenda is the Senkakus which I think he won and not the comfort women issue. I applaud him for really knowing his priorities. Whereas in SKorea, they brought out the comfort women issue and Pres Obama of course responded as he did.  Nothing bad with his response, I think.  Only, the SKoreans overhyped the response of the US pres and claimed the US Pres is on their side which I think is not.
 
 @Hachikou, I partially agree with you! It is fact that innocent Chinese civilians were killed by ex-Japanese troop. But question is how many??
 
 1? 2 people? Chinese claims 300000people in Nankjin, which is impossible considering population there  at that time. Recently, Koreans found diray of the man working at comfort women facility. We are looking for that kind of evidence.
 
 Unfortunatly Korean says most of context is gone, so it doens'T show the evidence that Japanese forcing sex as a slave. ?This was a terrible, egregious violation of human rights. Those women were violated in ways that, even in the midst of war were shocking,?   Obama did an absolute right thing to speak for the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  Furthermore, Obama has every right to tell the world the simple fact, as a decent human being as well as a president represent the US: the sexual enslavement of women by Japanese imperial force brutally violated those victims? basic rights,  in any occasions he sees fit.  (it's not up to Japan's approval.) Japanese govt should recognize Japan's horrendous wartime crimes committed to humanity, and stop manipulating and whitewashing the facts. The more Japan wants to hide the truth; the worse the Japan?s public image is portrayed in the world community.  It is sample like that, but Abe & Co. still don't get it.

I'm interested to hear why it's counter-productive.  The way I see it; The 'comfort women; issues is the main cause of poor relations between Japan and Korea. America desperately wants its closest Asian allies to get on - so he wants to encourage Japan to be more pro-active with demonstrating greater remorse and atonement and Korea to be less emotional and more flexible.  How do you see it? Ilgoo, Counter-productive because the REAL issue which is supposed to be the one on the topic table is weathered by South Korea's manipulations to divert and mislead everyone away from the Takeshima/Dokdo dispute.That's the real cause of poor relationship between Japan and RoK. The whole comfort women issue is all but cover-ups! Did you heard anything from Mr.Obama about the Island? None! Japan wants to settle it through the ICJ but RoK refused. Instead RoK uses propaganda about Comfort Women. hachikouAPR. 26, 2014 - 10:20PM JST

   You see, this is Exactly what I am talking about. Your logic is groundless. Instead of showing evidence , your logic is just ""everybody says blah bla blah"".
 
   Was any of UN member there at that facility during WW2? Name the witness! Show us the link. I would love to hear it. Originally Confort woman issue started from Japan not korea. Japan has been studied extensively including testimony and interview, whole nation wide debate had already done. Take a look at wikipedia. You will see the whole list of references and source of information.

Unfortunatly Korean says most of context is gone, so it doens'T show the evidence that Japanese forcing sex as a slave. You want to believe that the Japanese military was no worse than any other. They weren't, they were far worse.  What you and many Japanese fail to accept is that Japan committed the most heinous and inhumane war crimes above and beyond those of any other nation (and not terribly far from those of Germany).
 
 You cannot go on denying the Nanking massacre, the death railway, comfort women and torture and starvation of thousands of POW's in countries throughout Asia were fabrications.  Japan, stand up, face the facts, bow humbly express genuine regret and never forget. 
 
 Then, finally, we can all move on. Do nothing and Japan's isolation will only deepen. Katsunobu Kato, deputy chief cabinet secretary, said Japan was aware of the suffering of the victims and was trying to avoid politicizing the emotional issue. Hypocrites.  Then how come the General Counsel from the Japanese Embassy in New York went to Palisades Park in New Jersey to meet with the town council there to try to prevail on them to take down their monument remembering the Korean sex slaves?  Guess it can only be ""politicized"" when it is Japan doing it. @letsberealistic, Japan's isolation will deepen? Isolation in what sense? How many times Jpolitician would vow down? It would never really end simply because they want a slice of Japan not just expression of remorse. I still stand with my belief that those women discovered prostitution as a way of survival during the war. For nowhere else could you find plenty of provisions other than the military camps during war. And those very same obaachans re-discovered that by wailing about how they were ""forced"" to prostitute themselves during war, could make their remaining life comfortable . titaniumdioxideAPR. 26, 2014 - 10:39PM JST

Worse than two atomic bombs? Worse than Mao's greatest slaughter of millions of Chinese? Your definition of the word ""worse"" is subjective and is limited to yourself. You always talk about facts and Mr.hachikou is providing you one but you fail to acknowledge a single. Not very realistic! The real problem is Japanese think the  biggest mistake they regretted is they failed to win the WWII. Unrealistic BS! Worse than two atomic bombs? Worse than Mao's greatest slaughter of millions of Chinese? Your definition of the word ""worse"" is subjective and is limited to yourself. You always talk about facts and Mr.hachikou is providing you one but you fail to acknowledge a single. Not very realistic! Atomic bombing was a horrible act, brought on by a desperate US that could see Japan would fight until all were dead anyway - a horrible decision that some same had to be made, some say didn't. Maos' massacres were truly horrible and yes on a par, with Nanking and other Japanese massacres, but not, you did not happen during WW2 and were not committed by an invasionary foreign force but by their own people.  So, do you have anything on a par with what Japan did, during the war, that was not a desperate measure to end the war that seemed endless? I agree that Obama has done a bit of a snake act by waiting until he get to Korea to bring up this topic, but his Japan visit was more about socializing than discussing the issues at hand. There were no resolutions to the TPP or security and occupation by US troops. It was all beer and prawns! (Sake and sushi) - Obama's timing may not be great, but his point is relevant and must be addressed. I can just imagine Abe sitting back with his ten dollar sake saying, ""WTF? I thought we were best buddies!"" Pretty much what I thought would happen.  The US should not get involved unless it is prepared to mediate at a summit. Statements like this will only further highlight South Korea's and Japan's differences. A letter from the emperor
 
  Then some right-wing politician will say the Emperor was forced to write the letter and South Korea will reset relations to square 1 again. South Korea needs to say exactly what will put this issue permanently to bed. After that no whining about individual politicians saying X or doing Y. a law to ban denying comfort women! I disagree. No country should have laws on historical (re)interpretation. It is for academics to decide on history, not politicians. In Germany denying the Holocaust is a prosecutable crime.  Japan cannot claim a special dispensation, not with that giant precedent in effect for decades. ""Most historians"" ... is one of the most meaningless and overused memes in this debate. Most people cannot tell the difference between ""historians"" and ""war time propagandists"" past and current. Life is not a football game. I don't think like a nationalist. I don't own any people, they are not ""my people"". No Japanese alive today is guilty, nor needs to bear any guilt or shame for any action they did not carry out.  That is logical and that is the law.  They are no more or less guilty for others actions than you are. This is all a propaganda war. Elements within China, Korea, the USA wish to bow, damage or break today's Japanese, and damage public support for them abroad, e.g. in the USA. Many of those elements are government sponsored, they are encouraging a ripple of support amongst race haters. What a way to earn a living, or spend your life ... It and the conflict and hatred it encourages, is nothing more than a deluded and toxic mental pollution. There is always a price to pay, G7 group of nations agreed today to impose further sanctions on The Russia Federation, so that basically adds Japan to whatever ""significant impact"" these sanctions will take to stop Moscow backed pro-Russian separatist violence in eastern Ukraine. Also this morning pro-Russian separatists in Slavyansk are reportedly holding 13 Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe observers hostage. President Obama is requesting support for 2nd and 3rd stage sanctions, and EU governments are reticent, with Germany particularly resistant, if further UN resolutions are needed, then support in the shape of a positive vote, will be expected in return. Yes, that has be proven time and time again by studying the details and the provenance of the originals ... That was one of the issue with Iris Chang's campaign. It was shown to her and her publishers that a number of images were well known fabrication or falsely attributed and they refused to remove them. Punishment like stripping the flesh off things are not traditional Japanese punishments, which generally depended more on humiliation rather capital punishment. I am not a denier, I just get sick of these people peddling their nonsense generation after generation. That's why I just call them ""atrocity pornographers"".  There is no morality to their position, they just enjoy looking at and showing each other nasty pictures and calling girls bad names.  (*A simple truth folks,  More than 53% of Japanese are women and never had any part in anything you accuse, neither did the children who were made victims too, neither did the farmer who stayed at home and farmed, neither did the workers, neither even did the Navy or much of the army ... by the time you logically work out who might have been involved, it is down to a single % of the population,  less the a similar amount of criminals in any society, and a hell of a lot less than most societies*). After the war, the Germans and Japanese had a different reaction to their bad behavior during the war. Most of the Germans were remorseful and guilt ridden. The Japanese immediately tried to rewrite history, and are still at it. Within days of Japan's surrender in 1945, coded messages went out from Tokyo to Japanese diplomats around the world, ordering them to start a campaign portraying Japan as a victim in the war, and to play down Japanese atrocities and play up Japanese civilian losses in the recent atomic bomb attacks. What was not so secret were Japanese efforts to ignore the war and portray themselves as victims. Many Japanese opposed rewriting history, which was often quite blatant. This meddling with historical facts regularly caused problems with neighbors, especially Korea and China. But the Japanese were insistent on evading responsibility. They still are, and many Japanese really believe it. what South Korea failed to tell Obama is that they 1965 Treaty resolved all issues during Japan's Colonization of Korea, and Japan's past apologies.  Double Jeopardy? Japan has done that, yet Korea still plays the victim card, which it no longer is.  Korea have no shame. I agree with Obama, and I disagree with Japan -- it is a diplomatic topic.

Because the Japanese feel like they were the main victims of the war, it keeps throwing a sharp knife in the sides of the countries that were brutalized under the Japanse and this is the fundamental problem why the other countries equally will never let it rest. Compensation, smiles and handshakes are not enough. Had Germany gone the same route as Japan did, Europe would be a very different place today. Go to Germany and ask the average German about the war. Most Getmans think that part of their history was the worst and should never be repeated again. Everything was based on lies and they are ashamed of it. On the flip side, the Japanese think differently and for some reason it's everyone else's fault except Japan's. Had Japan gone the same route ad Germany, the relationship between Japan and Asia would have made this entire continent a mega powerhouse, stronger, wealthier, unstoppable.be that as it is Japan and this topic with its neighbors will never be resolved as long as Japan and it's sympathizers dig in their heels and play the card of victimization.

Yes, I would like to receive news alerts from JapanToday Terms of Service Japan says sex slave issue not a diplomatic topic after Obama comments Japan warned the issue of its wartime system of sex slavery was not a ?diplomatic? subject, after U.S. President Barack Obama on Friday called it a ?terrible? violation of human rights. Katsunobu Kato, deputy chief cabinet secretary, said Japan was aware of the suffering of the victims and was trying to avoid politicizing the emotional issue. ?Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said he is deeply pained to think of the people who experienced immeasurable pain and suffering,? Kato said in a television program. ?This issue should not be made into a political or diplomatic subject,? he said. In a press conference in South Korea Friday, Obama called for an accounting of the wrongs perpetrated by Japanese troops before and during World War II when thousands of women were forced into prostitution, many from the Korean peninsula. ?This was a terrible, egregious violation of human rights. Those women were violated in ways that, even in the midst of war were shocking,? Obama said. But the U.S. president also pressed Tokyo and Seoul to look to the future. ?It is in the interests of both Japan and the Korean people to look forwards as well as backwards and to find ways in which the heartache and the pain of the past can be resolved,? Obama said. Washington finds it frustrating that its two major allies in the region are unable to resolve their issues and work together on other pressing issues, such as an increasingly strident China and Pyongyang?s nuclear weapons program. Despite formal apologies issued by the Japanese government, South Korea accuses Tokyo of failing sufficiently to atone for the ?comfort women?, who were pressed to service its troops during its brutal war of expansion. Japan previously used a quasi-public fund to give compensation accompanied by a letter of apology from the prime minister. But Japan has long maintained that the two nations have resolved reparation issues from the World War II by signing treaties. Japanese media said Obama was trying to urge both Tokyo and Seoul to stabilize their working relationship. Obama was calling on Japan to take proactive stance on the comfort women issue, while also pressing Seoul to overcome emotional reaction, the liberal Tokyo Shimbun said in an analysis. The influential Asahi Shimbun said South Korea might heighten pressure on Tokyo to address the comfort women issue after the Obama remark. But the daily also said a piece of American advice was also directed at South Korea. ?Obama is seen calling on South Korea to become more flexible because the future-oriented cooperation between Japan and South Korea has not been able to move forward as South Korea strongly remains hung up on the past history,? the Asahi said.
 
  Back to top Back to top Order by Time Order by Popularity Login to comment Login to comment Wow, impressive to see Japan standing up for themselves this way. It's about time. When you play the door mat diplomatically with westerners it will not work out for you, you have to show some back bone. Japan warned the issue of its wartime system of sex slavery was not a ?diplomatic? subject Of course it is, not only in the eyes of the US and South Korea as illustrated here, but also the dozens of other countries from whom women were taken and used as sex slaves by the IJA. It doesn't matter whether Japan likes this or not - it's just fact. So, Japan should stick by it's apology and never allow statements to be made by any officials that undermine the merits of the apology to the broader international community. These things should be sacrosanct and never tinkered with under any circumstances. I've said before that people will forgive providing they feel as though there is genuine contrition expressed. But they won't forget, and they certainly won't just sit idly by to let Japan try to revise it's history. President Obama is not man of his word, untrustworthy, a political opportunist, telling Heads of State and Government what they want to hear. This is President Obama political back to the future, for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, it's Senkaku Islands and security issues, for South Korean President Park Geun-Hye it comfort women and sex slaves. Pure and shameless opportunism, propagating a false empathy to garner future support, seemingly unbiased, but deliberately manipulative.  Chief Cabinet Secretary Y?hei K?no statement is equivocal: ""Undeniably, this was an act, with the involvement of the military authorities of the day, that severely injured the honour and dignity of many women. The Government of Japan would like to take this opportunity once again to extend its sincere apologies and remorse to all those, irrespective of place of origin, who suffered immeasurable pain and incurable physical and psychological wounds as comfort women""...... August 4, 1993 President Obama failed to draw on this statement choosing instead to grandstand to the populists.   President Obama's imminent visit to the Philippines, and the announcement of a new U.S. Philippine alliance agreement so allowing U.S. forces to return to the Philippines more than two decades after the US forces withdrew could indicate the US government current agenda. Japanese were all in love with Obama, until he said something they didn't like.
 
 Japanese were all in love with Caroline Kennedy, until she said something they didn't like.
 
 Japanese were all in love with Clinton, until she said something they didn't like.
 
 Japanese were all in love with Park, until she said something they didn't like. When will Japan learn that having good relations does not mean agreeing on everything and always being 'nice'.
 
 Time for Japan to wake up to the realities of international relations, or become isolated like North Korea. Yes, today Japan is a peaceful nation who offers a lot of aid, but the international community agrees Japan should do more to show a genuine attitude of remorse for its actions during the war. well said Obama. we in Indonesia have bad history by japan too, thou we not care anymore as we feel they are peace. But when they dont admit and try to revise (if there is), it opens the crack back.  it doesnt same for everyone. And the best to move is to recognize their own history and dared to faced it..
 
 If America just sided with Japan, it'll look bad for others..Some right wing japanese might never understood, just try to view history book of other nation, even in indonesia and what it means to us...We today not live in faction community, but openly connected world..America has to remain true to peace order of all nations, not just japan and represent the voice of others too This is not a political issue. It is a moral issue! Everybody knows there are no morals in politics! Let the next round of (never ending) white washing of what Japan did or didn't do in regards to comfort women issue begin. Sounds like the Japanese media is generally not critical of Obama's speech then, especially the more liberal ones. 
 
 Japan needs to be more ""pro-active"" (in other words do more) about the lack of atonement for comfort women, and S. Korea needs to be more flexible and less emotional. Sounds perfectly fair -  Come on Japan be the adult in this relationship and make a step. A letter from the emperor, or better yet, a law to ban denying comfort women! Then all this would be over in day! A letter from the emperor a law to ban denying comfort women! I disagree. No country should have laws on historical (re)interpretation. It is for academics to decide on history, not politicians. GalapagosnoGairaishuAPR. 26, 2014 - 06:06PM JST
 
 Obama dined on 30,000-yen sushi and then on his way out left behind a tur*d on Japan's doorstep. What a shocking lack of common sense. No, what he left was a dose of reality medicine. His views reflect the international community - there is a growing attitude of revisionism and denial in Japan and if it continues Japan will become increasingly isolated. I disagree. No country should have laws on historical (re)interpretation. It is for academics to decide on history, not politicians. Then tell that to Japanese politicians. They are constantly giving their own versions of history which do not agree with the majority. Make it law and you don't have the problem of revisionism. Igloobuyer@Smart diplomacy is the art of knowing when to keep one's mouth shut. If Obama had intended to lecture the Japanese on the errors of their ways, he should have done it to their faces, and not across the ""East Sea."" Barack Obama has warned North Korea over nuclear testing, there are clear indications this is the fourth nuclear test, there needs to be complete unity between all governments.  Hardly a word has been muttered unless it a insult, how does stating the obvious, in such a manner, bring forth a harmonious response? GalapagosnoGairaishuAPR. 26, 2014 - 06:25PM JST
 
   Igloobuyer@Smart diplomacy is the art of knowing when to keep one's mouth shut. If Obama had intended to lecture the Japanese on the errors of their ways, he should have done it to their faces, and not across the ""East Sea."" I see no lecturing in his statement. He just said Japan needs to be more pro-active and Korea needs to be less emotional. Now do you know he didn't bring it up with Abe anyway? This is one of the issues contributing to the current diplomatic rift. Of course it's a ""diplomatic topic."" Gimme a break. Now do you know he didn't bring it up with Abe anyway? Well letsbe@ Isn't that the whole point here? Whatever Obama and Abe discussed was carefully vetted by their handlers before served for public consumption. In Korean the finger-wagging was done at a televised press conference. I bet you a kilo of kimchi that no Korean will escape the impression that Obama has taken their country's side in this particular dispute. Crimson and Clover Germany never would have responded this way. And that folks explains why Germany does not get treated this way anymore. The only explanation I have for why Japan insists on shooting itself in the foot is a traditional inexperience with dealing with the rest of the world.   It takes a serious navel gazer to not understand where this reaction is going to go after the hundredth time of the same reaction. Our president is a true diplomatic fool!!! Real stupidity is the only thing that I can think of that would lead him bring up this issue. Why blame the present day government of Japan for something that took place during WWII? How many times do the world have to tell you? ""Comfort woman was NOT sex slave but prostetutes. THere is a lot of evidence or documents for that.""
 
 ""THere is NO evidece existing that ex-Japanese troop force these woman to have sex in organized manner, while there is an evidence of ex-japanese troop that issued to prohibit its army or locala bases from forcing these women to have sex"" Evdence is the only way to show what really happened. Did Obama make the statement about comfort women in Japan, South Korea, or in both countries? If he did not say it while in Japan then why say it at all? In South Korea he is just singing to the choir. I wud bet some ca$h that Obama DID mention the sex slave issue, IN PRIVATE, hoping Japan would man up & take responsibility, PUBLICLY..................but alas once again we see Japan likes to take the low road, she will never learn by the looks of it & continues to reap what she has sewn for many many decades & STILL counting hachikouAPR. 26, 2014 - 09:03PM JST
 
   How many times do the world have to tell you?
 
   ""Comfort woman was NOT sex slave but prostetutes. THere is a lot of evidence or documents for that."" ""THere is NO evidece existing that ex-Japanese troop force these woman to have sex in organized manner, while there is an evidence of ex-japanese troop that issued to prohibit its army or locala bases from forcing these women to have sex""
 
   Evdence is the only way to show what really happened. Sure, and there was no Nanking massacre, no 'death railway', no torture and starvation of POW's, yes, Japan liberated Asia from the oppressive Western colonialists. You go ahead and believe what you want to believe, and the world will go on and believe what overwhelming evidence shows and never the twain shall meet. So everyone trashed Abe for running everything by visiting Yasukuni.
 
 So what do we call Obama who has been working to resolve SK-JPN tensions for the sake
 
 of US regional strategic policy, even reaching a point where both countries are prepared to discuss
 
 the issue together, and he comes out with this utterly stupid counter productive comment? Hachikou >How many times do the world have to tell you? What planet are you living on? UN and rest of the world acknowledge that the Japanese army forced these young women into sexual slaves. It's not only Korea. Wormen but Chinese, Taiwanese, Dutch, and etc. UN report clearly states up to 200,000 women forced into sexual slavery. So stop pretending to deny this fact. Absolutelt agree with subyyaki. Japan shows more backbone compared to my mommy jeans wearing President. I just think it's just a matter of interpretation from the Japanese and SKorean's sides. I just think Pres. Obama is being neutral and just natural in abhorring comfort women issue as a form of degradation of women since they brand it as sexual slavery. But I just think he says to move on and meet halfway to resolve the historical issue. He's not really siding. Since as one poster said PM Abe's main agenda is the Senkakus which I think he won and not the comfort women issue. I applaud him for really knowing his priorities. Whereas in SKorea, they brought out the comfort women issue and Pres Obama of course responded as he did.  Nothing bad with his response, I think.  Only, the SKoreans overhyped the response of the US pres and claimed the US Pres is on their side which I think is not.
 
 @Hachikou, I partially agree with you! It is fact that innocent Chinese civilians were killed by ex-Japanese troop. But question is how many??
 
 1? 2 people? Chinese claims 300000people in Nankjin, which is impossible considering population there  at that time. Recently, Koreans found diray of the man working at comfort women facility. We are looking for that kind of evidence.
 
 Unfortunatly Korean says most of context is gone, so it doens'T show the evidence that Japanese forcing sex as a slave. ?This was a terrible, egregious violation of human rights. Those women were violated in ways that, even in the midst of war were shocking,?   Obama did an absolute right thing to speak for the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  Furthermore, Obama has every right to tell the world the simple fact, as a decent human being as well as a president represent the US: the sexual enslavement of women by Japanese imperial force brutally violated those victims? basic rights,  in any occasions he sees fit.  (it's not up to Japan's approval.) Japanese govt should recognize Japan's horrendous wartime crimes committed to humanity, and stop manipulating and whitewashing the facts. The more Japan wants to hide the truth; the worse the Japan?s public image is portrayed in the world community.  It is sample like that, but Abe & Co. still don't get it.

So what do we call Obama who has been working to resolve SK-JPN tensions for the sake of US regional strategic policy, even reaching a point where both countries are prepared to discuss the issue together, and he comes out with this utterly stupid counter productive comment? I'm interested to hear why it's counter-productive.  The way I see it; The 'comfort women; issues is the main cause of poor relations between Japan and Korea. America desperately wants its closest Asian allies to get on - so he wants to encourage Japan to be more pro-active with demonstrating greater remorse and atonement and Korea to be less emotional and more flexible.  How do you see it? Ilgoo, Counter-productive because the REAL issue which is supposed to be the one on the topic table is weathered by South Korea's manipulations to divert and mislead everyone away from the Takeshima/Dokdo dispute.That's the real cause of poor relationship between Japan and RoK. The whole comfort women issue is all but cover-ups! Did you heard anything from Mr.Obama about the Island? None! Japan wants to settle it through the ICJ but RoK refused. Instead RoK uses propaganda about Comfort Women. hachikouAPR. 26, 2014 - 10:20PM JST

   You see, this is Exactly what I am talking about. Your logic is groundless. Instead of showing evidence , your logic is just ""everybody says blah bla blah"".
 
   Was any of UN member there at that facility during WW2? Name the witness! Show us the link. I would love to hear it. Originally Confort woman issue started from Japan not korea. Japan has been studied extensively including testimony and interview, whole nation wide debate had already done. Take a look at wikipedia. You will see the whole list of references and source of information.
 
   Recently, Koreans found diray of the man working at comfort women facility. We are looking for that kind of evidence. Unfortunatly Korean says most of context is gone, so it doens'T show the evidence that Japanese forcing sex as a slave. You want to believe that the Japanese military was no worse than any other. They weren't, they were far worse.  What you and many Japanese fail to accept is that Japan committed the most heinous and inhumane war crimes above and beyond those of any other nation (and not terribly far from those of Germany).
 
 You cannot go on denying the Nanking massacre, the death railway, comfort women and torture and starvation of thousands of POW's in countries throughout Asia were fabrications.  Japan, stand up, face the facts, bow humbly express genuine regret and never forget. 
 
 Then, finally, we can all move on. Do nothing and Japan's isolation will only deepen. Katsunobu Kato, deputy chief cabinet secretary, said Japan was aware of the suffering of the victims and was trying to avoid politicizing the emotional issue. Hypocrites.  Then how come the General Counsel from the Japanese Embassy in New York went to Palisades Park in New Jersey to meet with the town council there to try to prevail on them to take down their monument remembering the Korean sex slaves?  Guess it can only be ""politicized"" when it is Japan doing it. @letsberealistic, Japan's isolation will deepen? Isolation in what sense? How many times Jpolitician would vow down? It would never really end simply because they want a slice of Japan not just expression of remorse. I still stand with my belief that those women discovered prostitution as a way of survival during the war. For nowhere else could you find plenty of provisions other than the military camps during war. And those very same obaachans re-discovered that by wailing about how they were ""forced"" to prostitute themselves during war, could make their remaining life comfortable . titaniumdioxideAPR. 26, 2014 - 10:39PM JST

Worse than two atomic bombs? Worse than Mao's greatest slaughter of millions of Chinese? Your definition of the word ""worse"" is subjective and is limited to yourself. You always talk about facts and Mr.hachikou is providing you one but you fail to acknowledge a single. Not very realistic! The real problem is Japanese think the  biggest mistake they regretted is they failed to win the WWII. Unrealistic BS! Worse than two atomic bombs? Worse than Mao's greatest slaughter of millions of Chinese? Your definition of the word ""worse"" is subjective and is limited to yourself. You always talk about facts and Mr.hachikou is providing you one but you fail to acknowledge a single. Not very realistic! Atomic bombing was a horrible act, brought on by a desperate US that could see Japan would fight until all were dead anyway - a horrible decision that some same had to be made, some say didn't. Maos' massacres were truly horrible and yes on a par, with Nanking and other Japanese massacres, but not, you did not happen during WW2 and were not committed by an invasionary foreign force but by their own people.  So, do you have anything on a par with what Japan did, during the war, that was not a desperate measure to end the war that seemed endless? I agree that Obama has done a bit of a snake act by waiting until he get to Korea to bring up this topic, but his Japan visit was more about socializing than discussing the issues at hand. There were no resolutions to the TPP or security and occupation by US troops. It was all beer and prawns! (Sake and sushi) - Obama's timing may not be great, but his point is relevant and must be addressed. I can just imagine Abe sitting back with his ten dollar sake saying, ""WTF? I thought we were best buddies!"" Pretty much what I thought would happen.  The US should not get involved unless it is prepared to mediate at a summit. Statements like this will only further highlight South Korea's and Japan's differences. A letter from the emperor
 
  Then some right-wing politician will say the Emperor was forced to write the letter and South Korea will reset relations to square 1 again. South Korea needs to say exactly what will put this issue permanently to bed. After that no whining about individual politicians saying X or doing Y. a law to ban denying comfort women! I disagree. No country should have laws on historical (re)interpretation. It is for academics to decide on history, not politicians. In Germany denying the Holocaust is a prosecutable crime.  Japan cannot claim a special dispensation, not with that giant precedent in effect for decades. ""Most historians"" ... is one of the most meaningless and overused memes in this debate. Most people cannot tell the difference between ""historians"" and ""war time propagandists"" past and current. Life is not a football game. I don't think like a nationalist. I don't own any people, they are not ""my people"". No Japanese alive today is guilty, nor needs to bear any guilt or shame for any action they did not carry out.  That is logical and that is the law.  They are no more or less guilty for others actions than you are. This is all a propaganda war. Elements within China, Korea, the USA wish to bow, damage or break today's Japanese, and damage public support for them abroad, e.g. in the USA. Many of those elements are government sponsored, they are encouraging a ripple of support amongst race haters. What a way to earn a living, or spend your life ... It and the conflict and hatred it encourages, is nothing more than a deluded and toxic mental pollution. There is always a price to pay, G7 group of nations agreed today to impose further sanctions on The Russia Federation, so that basically adds Japan to whatever ""significant impact"" these sanctions will take to stop Moscow backed pro-Russian separatist violence in eastern Ukraine. Also this morning pro-Russian separatists in Slavyansk are reportedly holding 13 Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe observers hostage. President Obama is requesting support for 2nd and 3rd stage sanctions, and EU governments are reticent, with Germany particularly resistant, if further UN resolutions are needed, then support in the shape of a positive vote, will be expected in return. Yes, that has be proven time and time again by studying the details and the provenance of the originals ... That was one of the issue with Iris Chang's campaign. It was shown to her and her publishers that a number of images were well known fabrication or falsely attributed and they refused to remove them. Punishment like stripping the flesh off things are not traditional Japanese punishments, which generally depended more on humiliation rather capital punishment. I am not a denier, I just get sick of these people peddling their nonsense generation after generation. That's why I just call them ""atrocity pornographers"".  There is no morality to their position, they just enjoy looking at and showing each other nasty pictures and calling girls bad names.  (*A simple truth folks,  More than 53% of Japanese are women and never had any part in anything you accuse, neither did the children who were made victims too, neither did the farmer who stayed at home and farmed, neither did the workers, neither even did the Navy or much of the army ... by the time you logically work out who might have been involved, it is down to a single % of the population,  less the a similar amount of criminals in any society, and a hell of a lot less than most societies*). After the war, the Germans and Japanese had a different reaction to their bad behavior during the war. Most of the Germans were remorseful and guilt ridden. The Japanese immediately tried to rewrite history, and are still at it. Within days of Japan's surrender in 1945, coded messages went out from Tokyo to Japanese diplomats around the world, ordering them to start a campaign portraying Japan as a victim in the war, and to play down Japanese atrocities and play up Japanese civilian losses in the recent atomic bomb attacks. What was not so secret were Japanese efforts to ignore the war and portray themselves as victims. Many Japanese opposed rewriting history, which was often quite blatant. This meddling with historical facts regularly caused problems with neighbors, especially Korea and China. But the Japanese were insistent on evading responsibility. They still are, and many Japanese really believe it. what South Korea failed to tell Obama is that they 1965 Treaty resolved all issues during Japan's Colonization of Korea, and Japan's past apologies.  Double Jeopardy? Japan has done that, yet Korea still plays the victim card, which it no longer is.  Korea have no shame. I agree with Obama, and I disagree with Japan -- it is a diplomatic topic.

Because the Japanese feel like they were the main victims of the war, it keeps throwing a sharp knife in the sides of the countries that were brutalized under the Japanse and this is the fundamental problem why the other countries equally will never let it rest. Compensation, smiles and handshakes are not enough. Had Germany gone the same route as Japan did, Europe would be a very different place today. Go to Germany and ask the average German about the war. Most Getmans think that part of their history was the worst and should never be repeated again. Everything was based on lies and they are ashamed of it. On the flip side, the Japanese think differently and for some reason it's everyone else's fault except Japan's. Had Japan gone the same route ad Germany, the relationship between Japan and Asia would have made this entire continent a mega powerhouse, stronger, wealthier, unstoppable.be that as it is Japan and this topic with its neighbors will never be resolved as long as Japan and it's sympathizers dig in their heels and play the card of victimization.
