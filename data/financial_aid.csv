We also know that our student population is diverse and they have many different needs.

8882,"Student financial aid in the United States Student financial aid in the United States personal reflection or opinion essay help improve it room and board State governments also typically provide some types of need- and non-need-based aid, consisting of grants, work-study programs, tuition waivers, and scholarships. Individual colleges and universities may provide grants and need- and merit-based scholarships. Students requiring financial aid beyond what is offered by their institutions may consider a private (alternative) education loan, available from most large lending institutions. Typically, education loans obtained through the federal government have lower interest rates than private education loans. Institutions may also offer their own student financial assistance, in the form of need- or merit-based aid, as well as endowed scholarships (with varying need and/or merit-based criteria). Some institutions may only require the FAFSA; some may also require a need-based analysis document, such as the CSS/Profile, to apply for such funds to apply a more stringent need analysis for the rationalization of institutional funds. Types of financial aid and application process Merit-based aid versus need-based aid Common financial aid misconceptions College cost calculators No-loan financial aid Loan cap  Effect of Financial Aid on Enrollment Outside the United States Types of financial aid and application process Financial aid may be classified into two types based on the criteria through which the financial aid is awarded: merit-based or need-based. Student aid is awarded as grants and scholarships, low-interest, government-subsidized loans, and education tax benefits. Free Application for Federal Student Aid United States Department of Education In addition to federal student aid, students may be eligible for state-based aid. States provide students more than $10.2 billion of aid every year. Each state aid program is different. Usually, a student must reside and attend college in the state providing his/her aid. In some cases, a student can spend state aid on colleges in neighboring states. Most aid is provided on a first-come, first-served basis so it is essential that students prepare and submit their aid applications in as close to January 1 as possible. The aid ""window"" stays open 18 months in case student's financial circumstances change and require adjustment to their aid application. expected family contribution Merit-based grants or scholarships include scholarships awarded by the college or university and those awarded by outside organizations. Merit-based scholarships are typically? awarded for outstanding academic achievements and maximum SAT or ACT scores, although some merit scholarships can be awarded for special talents, leadership potential and other personal characteristics. Scholarships may be given because of group affiliation (such as YMCA, Boys Club, etc.). Merit scholarships are sometimes awarded without regard for the financial need of the applicant. At many colleges, every admitted student is automatically considered for merit scholarships. At other institutions, a separate application process is required. Scholarships do not need to be repaid as long as all requirements are met. Athletic scholarships are a form of merit aid that take athletic talent into account. Merit-based aid versus need-based aid With the yearly rising cost of tuition among schools across the nation, low-income students are finding it harder to pay for their education. In an attempt to help students meet the high, costly demands of college, schools have increased merit-based grants, for students with outstanding academic position, involvement in organizations, or high athletic talent. The issue is that these reasons for awarding scholarships take away from low-income students who often do not meet these merit standards. In other words, funds for merit-based scholarships are taking away from the already small amount of federal aid available to low-income students who simply cannot pay for college without some kind of financial aid. Common financial aid misconceptions There are several misconceptions surrounding financial aid: It is often believed that international (non-citizen) students are never eligible for financial aid. It is true that international students are not eligible for Federal aid. However, many universities provide their own institutional aid for international students (both need- and merit-based). Uni in the USA College cost calculators College cost calculator As defined in The Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008, the net price calculator?s purpose is: ??to help current and prospective students, families, and other consumers estimate the individual net price of an institution of higher education for a student. The net price calculator shall be developed in a manner that enables current and prospective students, families, and consumers to determine an estimate of a current or prospective student?s individual net price at a particular institution.? No-loan financial aid The following colleges and universities offer such no-loan financial aid packages as of March 2008: University of Maryland, College Park University of Chicago University of Pennsylvania University of Virginia Washington and Lee University Washington University in St. Louis College of William and Mary Some universities have opted to have a ""loan cap"" program, which is a maximum loan ? either per year or for the four years combined ? designed to reduce the cost of attendance for low-income and middle-class students.

Federal, state, institutional, and private fund(s) used to assist eligible students in funding their education. Financial aid can be a combination of scholarships, grants, loans, waivers, and student employment.

Student employment includes both work-study positions and part-time employment positions, either on- or off- campus.  Students at Texas A&M University received approximately $533 million in financial assistance through scholarships, grants, loans, waivers, work-study, and on-campus student employment. Approximately 71% of students?received some form of financial assistance. All forms of assistance continue to grow as well as the number of students receiving aid.

 		One of the ways many students choose to help fund their Biola education is by working on campus. From the Biola Bookstore to the Admissions Office, last year over 800 students were employed in a variety of on-campus jobs. 
 
 		Off-campus job opportunities are also available, and local businesses often post new positions through the Office of Career Development in Student Services. 
 
 		Our On-Campus Student Employment office handles on-campus jobs. On-Campus Student Employment is located in Metzger Hall, the main administration building for the University, and is open from 8:30 a.m.- 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. When you know your class schedule for the semester and the hours you will be available to work, you can check the On-Campus jobs folder in Firstclass to see if any of the open positions interest you, or come to the office to look at the job postings board. There, you will be assisted in identifying positions that will best match your skills, interests and time frame. Completed applications should be taken to the department you are applying to. It is each department's responsibility to conduct interviews and make job offers. A downloadable version of the application can be found in the On-Campus jobs folder in FirstClass or you can pick one up in the On-Campus Student Employment office. 
 
 		Note: If you plan to apply for an on-campus job at Biola, make sure you bring from home proof of eligibility to work in the United States in order to complete the required paperwork. All documents must be originals. Some common types of identification we see are: 
 
 		When you have been offered a job on campus you will return to the On-Campus Student Employment office to complete the following necessary hiring forms: 
 
 		Be sure to bring proof of eligibility to work such as Social Security card, valid Driver's License, passport, or visa documentation as listed above. International students (F-1 visa) must bring their I-20, passport, and Social Security card. 
 
 		Once these forms have been completed, On-Campus Student Employments will issue your first time card, color-coded in blue, which signifies your readiness to begin work on campus. You will also be given instructions on how to access and complete future web timecards. At this time you may also complete paperwork for the direct deposit of your paycheck or to have part or all of your paycheck applied to your school bill. 
 
 		It is recommended that all undergraduate student limit their work to 20 hours per week on campus when classes are in session, and 40 hours per week when classes are not in session. However, this guideline is a federal requirement for non-immigrant students attending on F-1 visas. 
 
 		Student employees at Biola complete time cards. Paychecks are issued biweekly from the Accounting Department in Metzger. You may choose to have a portion of your paycheck applied directly to your student bill. This is accomplished by completing a voluntary payroll deduction form which is available in the On-Campus Student Employment office. Both the On-Campus Student Employment and Accounting departments are ready to assist you. 
 
 		You are allowed a paid rest period of 10 minutes in each of the morning and afternoon work periods if the work period is four or more hours. Rest periods may not be skipped to reduce time from regular hours of work in order to leave work early. 
 
 		Students are not required to work more than five hours without a meal break of 30 minutes. If the total work period for the day is not more than six hours, then the meal period may be waived by mutual consent between the student and the supervisor. If your shift is longer than six hours, a 30-minute, unpaid meal break is required. Meal time is unpaid and may be 30 to 60 minutes, depending on the department's schedule. 
 
 		Students paid an hourly wage are eligible for overtime pay. Overtime is paid at 1 1/2 times the regular hourly rate after 8 hours of work in one day or 40 straight time hours worked in a week. 
 
 		Student workers are not awarded paid holidays. However, if a supervisor requires work on a holiday, the students will receive double time for working on Biola holidays. If the date of a Biola-observed holiday does not match the date of the nationally observed holiday, the holiday bonus will be paid to student employees who work on either day. However, if a student works on both days, only one day will be payable as a holiday. 
 
 		When you are hired for a position at Biola, you are making a serious commitment. The department that has hired you will depend on you to perform specific duties. Notify your supervisor promptly if you have a change of schedule, if you are sick, or if you are going to be late. When you are unable to work, it is important to let your supervisor know at the beginning of the work day. Just as in any job, you will be expected to be prompt, reliable, dependable, and willing to perform the work required. Should you decide to terminate your position, it will be important to give your supervisor a reasonable notice of termination. 
 
 		At Biola, we are very concerned about the occupational safety of faculty, staff, and students. A hazard-free environment is not only safer, but also more enjoyable to work in; therefore, our desire is the prevention of work-related injuries and illness. 
 
 		After you are hired for an on-campus job, your supervisor will go over the Student Employee Safety Agreement Form with you. They will identify the potential hazards specific to your job and instruct you in how to safely operate any machinery your job may require. Consult your supervisor regarding safety expectations, as discipline for unsafe acts varies by department. Student workers are expected to refrain from horseplay and dangerous behavior on the job, and to consider their safety and the safety of others at all times. 
 
 		It is the policy of Biola University that the workplace be free of illicit drugs and alcoholic beverages, and free of their use. The University wishes to provide a drug-free work place for its employees. The on-campus manufacturing, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of a controlled substance is unlawful, violates the University ""Standard of Conduct,"" and is therefore prohibited. 
 
 		FICA (Social Security and Medicare) and DI (Disability Insurance) are not deducted from on-campus student employees who are enrolled in 12 or more units at Biola University and do not regularly work more than 20 hours per week. However, if a student works on campus when school is not in session, and is not enrolled in a class at Biola, the law requires that the FICA and DI be deducted from the student paychecks. 
 
 		Students attending Biola on non-immigrant (F1) visas are FICA and DI exempt. 
 
 		If a problem arises, first talk it over with your supervisor. Discussion usually leads to a better working relationship as well as a better working environment. If you fail to reach a satisfactory understanding with your supervisor, you may take the matter up with that person's immediate supervisor. You should notify your supervisor of your intent beforehand. If you are still unable to come to a satisfactory solution, you may take your concern to the Student Employment Administrator in Human Resources. Supervisors and department heads have a joint responsibility to be aware of and to resolve such employee-supervisor matters in a cooperative, mutually beneficial fashion. In almost all cases a solution is reached at this level. 
 
 		If any student believes that he or she is the victim of any type of harassment, including sexual or racial harassment, the student should immediately report the incident to an immediate supervisor. If that supervisor is involved in the problem, the report should be made to Human Resources. The University will fully and effectively investigate any such report and will take whatever corrective action is deemed necessary. The University will also take action to protect the reporting student to prevent further harassment or retaliation. 
 
 		The University expects employees to be well-groomed and dressed in a manner appropriate for their work. In general your appearance should be modest, in good taste, safe and suitable for the work to be done. 
 
 		You'll find that the appropriate dress will vary by department. In Facilities Services or in food services, you will be required to wear a uniform. There may also be protective equipment such as safety goggles that will be required in some jobs. In other positions appropriate office attire could be important. It is helpful to check with your supervisor to learn exactly what is expected. 
 
 		A good rule to follow is to wear clothing that generally matches that of non-student employees doing similar jobs in the department. This is especially important in positions that ""meet the public."" 
 
 		If while on the job a student employee suffers an injury the student should report to the Biola Health Center immediately to obtain treatment. If it is a life threatening injury, the student should seek treatment at the closest ER.The Health Center is open Monday - Friday, 8 am - 5 p.m. The center will either treat the injury or direct the student to our primary facility for occupational injuries. The student will need to go to the Human Resources department to receive the appropriate worker's compensation paperwork. 
 
 		The contracted emergency medical facility that we use is St. Jude Heritage Medical Group at 2720 N. Harbor Blvd, Suite 130, Fullerton at 714-449-6200. Our secondary facility is Healthfirst Medical Group ? North at 11817 E. Telegraph Rd, Santa Fe Springs at 562-949-9328. Within three days, after the student has received emergency treatment for his or her injury, the student must return the paperwork to the Human Resources office. On-the-job safety is included in the performance evaluation of all Biola employees. 
 
 		Biola encourages supervisors to evaluate student employees. This proves to be a valuable tool in helping student employees find out how they are doing on their jobs and provides an excellent means of communication and development. 
 
 		If you are hired on campus and start on or more of your workdays between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 a.m., Monday through Friday, you may qualify in our commuter program. It could mean payment of a ""dollar a day"" by walking, biking, using transit, or carpooling to work. Biola's contribution to the cause for cleaner air is contained within the provisions of the Commuter Incentive Program. Enrolling in the program will be done by the information you provide on your Hiring Authorization form. Please pick up a Commuter Incentive claim form from Human Resources or University Employment on campus if you are eligible for any part of each month. Tuition and Costs 
 
 		The investment of a Biola education includes tuition, room and board (housing and a meal plan), books, and miscellaneous fees or expenses. All students under 20 years old, not living at home, are required to live in on-campus housing and have a meal plan. 
 
 		Each unit above 18 or below 12 is $1,389 per unit. The fee to audit a class is $50 per unit.

Log in to Self-Service Banner Code of Conduct Code of Conduct *All Lamar University Students are required to use their lamar.edu email accounts for all email correspondence with financial aid staff, including updates and missing paperwork. It is recommended that you check your Lamar email account at least once a week. *It is the responsibility of the student to inform the Office of Student Financial Assistance if a change in the student?s classification has occurred (ex: from an Undergraduate (UG) to a Post Baccalaureate (PB) or Graduate (GR), etc.). This includes changing from a traditional student to an online academic partnership student and vice versa. Initial notifications of financial aid are tentative, and are based on the assumption that the student?s classification is the same as the prior semester. It is essential that the student communicate any change in his/her classification to the financial aid staff during the period leading up to the beginning of each semester as it may impact the student?s aid eligibility. If the student does not provide notification of this change it may not be until later in the semester that this is identified, potentially resulting in aid adjustments and possibly leaving the student with a balance owed to the university. -The Bachelor of Applied Arts and Science (BAAS) and General Studies are not eligible for financial aid as a Post Baccalaureate.

Ross University School of Medicine is committed to providing medical students with information to help them fund their education through student loan programs, medical school financial aid, and scholarships. Financial aid is available to all eligible students. Approximately 85% of Ross University students receive some assistance. Students accepted for admission to Ross University School of Medicine, and those who are in attendance and maintaining standards of satisfactory academic progress, may apply for student loans through?either government?or private programs to meet direct and indirect educational expenses. The maximum loan amount for which a student is eligible may not exceed the cost of attendance (as defined by?Ross University School of Medicine)?for the academic period in which the student is enrolled. Families should make every possible effort to attain the needed  resources for education. Financial aid is intended to fill the gap that  may exist between a family's ability to afford educational expenses and  the cost of attendance. Typically, students at Ross University School of Medicine finance the  cost of their education by combining family resources, federal student  loans, and scholarships, and loans from other sources. It is advisable  for all students - including those who have applied for financial aid -  to bring sufficient funds with them to cover their initial month's  living? expenses. Free Appplication for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) The Office of Student Finance assists students in applying for several types of financial aid from a variety of sources. RUSM maintains a strong commitment to providing financial counseling to students prior to their matriculation and throughout their education, so that they understand the financial commitment and risks they assume when agreeing to the terms of a student loan. We also encourage students to borrow the minimum amount needed.

As a result, these funds are awarded on a first-come, first-served basis. Students should file their FAFSA as early as possible and reply to requests for information promptly to ensure consideration for this type of funding. Students should apply for aid even if they missed the priority filing date because they may still qualify for the Federal Pell Grant or Federal Direct Loans. If students have not applied in a timely manner, they may want to participate in the Installment Payment Plan. Students who receive a Federal Title IV Grant or loan assistance and withdraw from VCU before completing 60% of the semester must have their eligibility recalculated based on the Federal Return of Title IV Funds formula. This formula recalculates a student's eligibility based on the aid the student has ""earned"" (number of days enrolled/attended prior to withdrawal). Any unearned aid must be returned to the appropriate Title IV program(s) and the students must pay all or a portion of the funds that were disbursed to their accounts. They also may be responsible for all or a portion of the charges that were previously paid by financial aid. If a student does not officially withdraw from all classes but fails to earn a passing grade in at least one course, federal aid regulations require that we assume the student has ?unofficially withdrawn,? unless it can be documented that the student completed the enrollment period. Unofficial withdrawals require a Title IV refund calculation at the midpoint of the enrollment period.

     As a full-time undergraduate student at university or college, you'll normally have to pay for your tuition fees as well as your living costs for the duration of your degree. You can apply to Student Finance England (SFE) for loans and grants to help with these costs.
 
  
 
     If you've lived in the UK for at least three years (and this is where you usually live) then you'll probably be eligible for a Tuition Fee Loan to cover the cost of your tuition fees. This is paid directly to your university or college. You'll also be able to get a Maintenance Loan to help towards your living expenses, such as rent and bills.
 
  
 
     If you're from a lower income-family  you'll be able to apply for a Maintenance Grant from SFE. The Maintenance Grant helps with your living costs.  
 
  
 
     There?s also extra support for those with special circumstances. That might include you if, for example, you have children (or adult dependant), a disability, a long-term health condition, a mental health condition or a specific learning difficulty.
 
  
 
     Even if you don't qualify for additional funding from SFE you may be able to get other bursaries or grants from your university or college.

888488,"Applying for Aid Recognition and Achievement Federal and State Grants About the Program Although students and their families bear the primary responsibility for meeting costs, many find they cannot pay the full cost of an education by themselves. In most cases, your financial aid package will involve family contributions, your acceptance of federal assistance (including grants and loans), and financial aid from John Brown University. These financial assistance programs help fill the gap between the amount your family is expected to pay and the total educational cost. For more and more families, federal loan programs offer a reasonable option for covering the balance of educational costs after other resources have been considered. The amount the family is expected to pay is based on information provided on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FASFA). The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) John Brown University is a private Christian university, ranked first in best value among Southern regional colleges by U.S. News & World Report and is listed as one of America?s Best Colleges by Forbes.

888131,"Ways to Give Tips for applying Below is a brief description of the Oklahoma State Grants: Oklahoma's Promise (OHLAP) is a grant provided by the state of Oklahoma. Students who meet qualifications can apply in the eighth, ninth and tenth grades (home school students must be ages 13, 14 or 15). To qualify, parents' income from taxed and untaxed sources must be $50,000 or less at the time the student applies for the program. In addition, students must complete the required academic courses while in high school. After initial qualification, students must meet annual criteria to receive Oklahoma?s Promise funding, and are required to submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) each academic year to determine ongoing eligibility. Oklahoma Tuition Aid Grant (OTAG) is a grant awarded by the State of Oklahoma. Eligibility is determined by the results of the FAFSA and by the OTAG residency requirements. OTAG is applied directly to the student's account and does not have to be repaid. Students must complete and submit the FAFSA by March 15 to be considered for OTAG. The amount is subject to change based on the availability of funds. OTAG Grants are not available to students who have already completed their first bachelor's degree. If you have external scholarships that you are expecting to assist you in the 2014-2015 academic year, they will not be credited to your student account until we receive the funds. If you are expecting assistance from a source outside of Oklahoma City University, please email your financial aid counselor so the funds can be estimated in your overall financial aid award package. It is important to remember that additional assistance that is identified to our office after a student has received their aid package may result in a revision of their initial award package.

The scholarship is named for Anees A. Haddad, a long-time La Sierra Professor of Sociology and Family Studies, former Director of the Division of Behavioral Sciences and Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. Dr. Haddad?s career of excellence as teacher, scholar and academic administrator represents the best of La Sierra?s cross-cultural tradition which has enriched the lives of all individuals in the La Sierra community.   Nellie Nehme Haddad, born in a picturesque mountain village in Southern Lebanon, soon moved with her family to Beirut. While attending Middle East College, she met and married Anees A. Haddad.? A few years after the birth of a son and twin daughters, Nellie began experiencing heart problems related to her childhood rheumatic fever. Through her husband?s determination, the family came to Loma Linda University Medical Center, where Nellie was the first patient to receive a double valve replacement. Although she endured many additional surgeries, Nellie?s attitude of courage and optimism, love of family and grandchildren and artistic talent did not leave room for complaints in her life. Her family and friends established this endowment in memory of Nellie and her attitude of always helping others.   The Lam Family Endowment has been established by Harry, Fred and Charles Lam to aid Chinese students from Hong Kong, China, Singapore and other Asian countries. The Lam brothers desire to encourage students toward academic excellence. They especially want to help students who have been serving the church and wish to further their studies and return to serve their homeland.   Tracy Teele shaped much of what La Sierra University is today. Except for a $15 gift, he earned his entire way through academy and college without loans or scholarships, and on graduation day married Marilyn Manuel. He immediately became dean of men at Monterey Bay Academy, then dean of men at La Sierra at the young age of 26, and later served as vice president for student affairs. Tracy instituted the first Seventh-day Adventist resident assistant program; helped design Sierra Towers; initiated student counseling centers and freshman/parent orientation weekends; and marketed La Sierra to international students. After helping feed 300 Vietnamese refugees, Tracy adopted and educated three of them. He earned a master?s of education from Boston University and completed course work for his doctorate in student personnel administration in higher education from the University of Denver. Tracy died at the apex of his career at age 49. This memorial scholarship was created to aid worthy students in financial need.

888375,"Donate to King How to Apply for Aid Apply for Federal Loans I have a Question Student Right to Know Your college education is a big investment?one of the biggest you?ll ever make in your life. King University will do everything we can to make your experience affordable. But an investment isn?t just about price?it?s also about value. You can select from more than 80 academic programs. You can even design your own major. More than 80 percent of all King graduates complete their degree within four years. The national rate, according to a 2011 ACT College Student Retention and Graduation Rages report, indicates only 23 percent of college graduates complete their degree within four years. The sooner you graduate, the sooner you can start your career?and the more money you?ll save. A King University degree opens doors. During the previous two years, an average of more than 85 percent of graduates seeking employment were employed within their major field six months after graduation. Of the King graduates who choose to continue their education, more than 80 percent are accepted into their first choice of graduate or professional school. In fact, this past year, 75 percent of those pursuing medical school and 100 percent of those pursing pharmacy school were accepted at their first choice institution. With so many financial aid options available, you'll be surprised at how affordable a King education can be. When you factor in grants and scholarships, work-study programs, federal and state assistance, and loans, your actual cost can often be equal to a public four-year college. Your college education is an investment, King University will do everything we can to make your experience affordable. But an investment isn't just about price - it's also about value. And that is where King departs from the ordinary. At King University, our financial aid administrators will help ease your mind about expenses so you can focus on what really matters - how King benefits you academically. We are happy to meet with you and your family personally to discuss any questions or concerns you may have. If you're committed to attending King University, we're committed to helping you finance your education.

 							  Scholarships and Financial Aid (OSFA)							   Scholarships and Awards College of Arts and Sciences Scholarships and Awards College of Health and Human Services Scholarships and Awards Watson School of Education Scholarships and Awards Scholarships Awarded by Off-Campus Agencies Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) for Financial Aid Eligibility Policy on Return of Title IV Funds The primary mission of the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid (OSFA) is to assist prospective and currently enrolled students, and the student?s family in securing the most suitable financial aid as the student pursues a degree* or certificate at UNCW. Through our outreach efforts, we support the university?s mission, including the commitment to public service. To this end, we administer federal, state and institutional student financial aid programs in excess of $96 million to assist UNCW students. Residency for admission purposes does not affect dependency status for financial aid purposes. The university considers under representation of North Carolina cultural populations, based on the current census data, within the UNCW student body in making diversity scholarship awards. The university also considers under representation of students from families with incomes below the average family income in North Carolina in making diversity scholarship awards. UNCW utilizes its diversity scholarships to help insure an increase in the diversity of the student body sufficient to enhance the academic experience available at the university. In so doing, the university employs the socio-economic diversity found within the population of the state as a measure of its effort to obtain greater diversity among its student population, including, but not limited to, consideration of exceptional financial need. To retain a diversity scholarship, each student must maintain at least a 2.00 grade point average. University personnel may determine that a diversity scholarship may be retained despite the failure to maintain a 2.00 academic average when such a failure is clearly the result of documented exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the student. Students admitted to UNCW do not need to file a separate application for this scholarship. All incoming freshmen are considered. UNCW has numerous scholarships that have been generously donated in honor of individuals or organizations. Each of these scholarships has specific and unique criteria. While some are available to one or more students each academic year, others are renewable and only become available after the current recipient has graduated or becomes ineligible for the scholarship. Because competition for scholarships is intense, merit scholarships are usually available only to the most outstanding new freshmen and continuing students as determined by the award authority. The value of the scholarship is determined based on annual earnings. Scholarships designated ?Honors? are for students accepted into the UNCW Honors Scholars Program. Those students are contacted by the Honors Scholars Program with further information. If financial need is part of the eligibility criteria, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) must be filed. Most scholarships are awarded in the late spring or early summer for the upcoming academic year. School of Health and Applied Human Sciences School of Nursing Students may contact the School of Nursing for information and application instructions regarding the following scholarships: School of Social Work Cameron School of Business Scholarships and Awards Students may contact the Cameron School of Business for information and application instructions regarding the following scholarships: Students may contact the Watson School of Education, Dean?s Office, for information regarding the following scholarships: The following scholarships are awarded to UNCW students by off-campus agencies. Unless otherwise noted, completing the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid (OSFA) scholarship application online is necessary to be considered for these scholarships. Office of Financial Aid Students who received a Federal Subsidized or Unsubsidized Direct Student Loan or Perkins Loan must complete an exit interview prior to leaving UNCW. Exit interviews must be completed by students who withdraw or graduate. It is important that students who borrow Perkins and Direct Student loans realize that the loans require repayment, usually within 10 years after leaving school. Loan calculators are available at the interview Web site demonstrating estimated loan payments and approximate income required to make payment. Two exceptions to the above are: A goal of the OSFA is to assist students eligible for veterans? benefits with counseling regarding their coursework and benefits while they work to successfully complete their desired educational objective within the guidelines of the North Carolina State Approving Agency. The monitoring of attendance, successful completion of courses and the pursuit of appropriate curricula are required. Services to veterans and dependents include referrals to peer and professional counseling, employment, community outreach services, tutorial services and special programs for educationally disadvantaged veterans. The Standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress for Financial Aid (Undergraduate Students) Federal Regulations require UNCW to establish Standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) in the following three areas: cumulative GPA (qualitative), hours earned (quantitative), maximum time limit. The Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid (OSFA) is responsible for establishing SAP standards and monitoring students? progress at UNCW. Financial aid recipients must maintain satisfactory progress in all three areas whether or not aid was received in the past. This requirement applies to all financial aid applicants and assesses all students equally, regardless of enrollment hour status (full-time, part-time, etc.). It is the student?s responsibility to stay informed of UNCW?s SAP standards and to monitor their own progress. Graduate students should see SAP in the graduate catalogue. Reinstatement of Financial Aid Eligibility and Appeals Policy on Return of Title IV Funds Financial aid eligibility may be regained by eliminating all satisfactory academic progress deficiencies (at the student?s expense) until the requirements of this policy are met, or by appealing their satisfactory academic progress status. The sections following describe the areas a student is required to remedy in order to regain financial aid eligibility. Students who do not enroll for a semester, or pay for school at their own expense, do not automatically qualify to receive financial aid in a subsequent semester. The terms and conditions of the Satisfactory Academic Policy must be met. Federal regulations allow for certain cases in which the school may waive the standards. Appeals for the waiver may be considered if a student?s failure to comply with one or more areas of Satisfactory Academic Progress is due to events beyond the student?s control, such as a student?s extended illness, serious illness or death in the immediate family or other significant life experience that impacted the student?s emotional and/or physical health, and if such mitigating circumstances can be appropriately documented for the specific term(s) in which the deficiency occurred. Eligibility may be regained by appeal. Contact the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid to obtain a Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) Appeal Form. SAP appeals are considered on a case-by-case basis. Some appeals may be approved for a probationary term. If this is the case, the student may be required to sign an academic plan contract that specifies conditions necessary to be eligible for the following term. These conditions may include: The academic plan contract states the consequences of failure to meet those requirements. Summer term is considered a trailer for financial aid purposes. Students are able to use any remaining financial aid eligibility from the 2010-2011 academic year to assist with summer expenses based on enrollment in the summer term. A summer financial aid application is available on the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid (OSFA) Web site in early April each year. Students are encouraged to file the 2011-12 FAFSA to determine the most beneficial award for summer term. In order to have financial aid applied to the student account and receive a refund in the first session of summer, the student must be registered for six hours during summer session I. A refund of aid will not be available until the student has begun attending a minimum of six hours during the summer. For example, if the student is registered for three hours summer session I and three hours summer session II, a refund of financial aid funds will not be available until the beginning of summer session II when the student begins attending the full six hours. Classes can be held until summer session II aid is applied to the student account. Students are responsible for book money and living expenses until summer II classes start at the end of June. Federal financial aid funds are awarded with the expectation that students will complete the entire period of enrollment. Students ?earn? a percentage of the funds they are disbursed with each day of class attendance. When a student who has received federal financial aid funds (Title IV Funds) leaves school before the end of the semester or period of enrollment, federal law requires UNCW to calculate the percentage and amount of ?unearned? financial aid funds that must be returned to the federal government. Once a student has completed more than 60% of the enrollment period, students are considered to have earned all funding received. This calculation may have the effect of requiring the student to repay funds that have already been disbursed to the student. Students are encouraged to meet with their financial aid counselor prior to making the decision to withdraw from school. Back to Top"

Transcripts (both unofficial and official) may not be viewed or released if a transcript hold is in place. University of the Rockies is required to charge sales tax for tuition and/or fees in certain jurisdictions based on state reporting obligations and the taxability of services and digital goods in accordance with local law on the date of charge. For sales tax purposes, electronically-delivered services and digital goods are considered to be received at the student's physical address. For specific sales tax charges, students should consult with their Student Advisor (online) or Financial Aid Office (Colorado Springs campus and Denver Instructional Site). The Course Digital Materials System, which is known as Constellation?, is designed to help students master the instructional goals of University of the Rockies degree programs. These custom course digital materials (CDM) are created specifically to support University of the Rockies' curriculum. Course materials include essential readings, audio and video assets, interactive exercises, and other digital supplements. These materials may be displayed on a browser-based Constellation? Reader or on a number of devices, such as the iPhone, Kindle, and Blackberry. For courses where course digital materials are provided in lieu of textbooks, a $75.00 fee (CDM fee) is applied directly to the student's account concurrent with the charge for tuition. Students are not charged the CDM fee for repeated coursework if previously charged. Once students have access to their course digital materials through the online classroom, they can print without restriction, keep materials for future reference, or share with friends. Students may read their materials online or download and save them to their hard drive. However, students may also want to download their materials to other devices, such as the iPhone or Kindle. Still others will want to save their materials on a thumb drive or print the materials. Constellation? does not include restrictions on file storage or print functions. Full functionality of Constellation? is best experienced with the included reader. The Constellation? Reader will allow students to highlight material in a variety of colors, create notes, and make bookmarks. While the reader offers robust functionality, students will be able to access, download, and print their learning materials in accordance with their preferences. Students will lose access to any course digital materials approximately 60 days after the end of their course or their withdrawal date, unless they have downloaded the material to an external device or hard drive. Tennessee Tuition and Fee Guarantee Applicants to an online program who reside in the state of Tennessee (as evidenced by the address on file at University of the Rockies) will qualify for the Tennessee Tuition and Fee Guarantee under the conditions set forth in this section. The Tennessee Tuition and Fee Guarantee is a commitment that the net cost of tuition and fees will not increase for a 12 month period, beginning on the date the student begins credit-bearing coursework. This benefit is applicable only to students who maintain a physical residence in the state of Tennessee. Upon expiration of the 12 month period, tuition and fee amounts for any such students are subject to adjustment to reflect the rates in effect at that time, and will also be subject to future adjustments. Students who relocate to another state are no longer eligible for the Tennessee Tuition and Fee Guarantee, and tuition and fees will be adjusted to reflect the rates in effect at that time, and will also be subject to future adjustments, starting on the date their address is changed in University records. No retroactive tuition and fee adjustments for past classes are applied at the time of any address update. No retroactive tuition and fee adjustments for current classes are applied at the time of any address update, unless the address change is updated in University records within the first week of a student?s current course. Students who apply to a new degree program are eligible for the Tennessee Tuition and Fee Guarantee for a new 12 month period beginning on the date the student begins credit-bearing coursework. Students who submit a new admissions application to change their program of study are also eligible for the Tennessee Tuition and Fee Guarantee for a new 12 month period beginning on the date the student begins credit-bearing coursework. Students who change specializations or re-enter the University after being out of attendance and are not required to submit a new admissions application do not qualify for a new or renewed Tennessee Tuition and Fee Guarantee period. Delinquent Accounts and Financial Hold An administrative fee may be assessed to a student?s account for any outstanding balances, late payments, or insufficient funds. Payment plans allow Colorado Springs campus students to pay their outstanding account balance in two equal monthly installments, guaranteeing that the balance will be paid in full by the end of the term. For Denver Instructional Site and online, payment plans allow for students in a non-term format to maintain continuous enrollment by offering monthly payments to cover any outstanding charges they have incurred throughout the course of their program. Each individual payment plan will not exceed twelve (12) months of repayment. Invoices may be sent out periodically to students with outstanding balances. These invoices will be sent to the email address on file; the student is responsible for ensuring the accuracy of this information with the Registrar?s Office. The invoice will reflect charges for current registered classes only. If a change is made to the student?s schedule which results in an increase of the tuition bill for the term, the student is accountable for ensuring the updated payment is made. Students who are more than one week late in making payments on the payment plan may be assessed a $25 late fee and may be administratively withdrawn from the program until their account is paid in full. Documentation required for the Tuition Reimbursement Plan: Documentation required for Direct Bill Plan: University of the Rockies Institutional Loan is offered to students who qualify and is available in two options. Option 1: This option offers no fees; a 4.5% fixed interest rate that will not accrue until after the six month grace period after the student is determined to be inactive with the university. Option 2: This option offers a 0% loan with no origination fees and a 0% percent interest rate for the lifetime of the loan. To qualify, students are required to make a minimum payment of $50.00 per month while in attendance at University of the Rockies and during the first six months of repayment. The University of the Rockies Institutional Loan program is available only to students who do not obtain federal loans (either Direct Loans or Graduate PLUS loans) to finance their education at University of the Rockies and is subject to availability. The maximum loan amount is $20,500 per academic year. In-school deferment is only applicable while borrowers are in attendance at University of the Rockies. For more information, please contact your Financial Services Advisor. Note: University of the Rockies will award loans to a limited number of enrolled students in good standing. University of the Rockies has a limited pool of funds for this institutional loan program. Students seeking to participate in this loan program must apply. The University reserves the right to modify or amend its credit and/or underwriting criteria at any time. When selected as a secondary payment option, any amount not covered by the primary payment option can be applied in any acceptable form of payment. Credit cards bearing high interest rates should not be used as a long-term financing method for educational costs. University of the Rockies encourages all students to utilize the free financial counseling provided by the Financial Aid Office. Students may choose to place a credit card on file for automatic recurring payment processing. Non-Degree Seeking students will be required to place a credit card on file (debit cards are not accepted) when selecting this option with authorization to charge the card if tuition is not paid within a sixty (60) day timeframe.

When this occurs, such as during the annual winter break, the non-enrollment period may extend the 14 day limit to include the break. Approved students may obtain a book voucher code through their Student Advisor or Military Specialist. How it works: To be eligible to enroll in Compact Service Corps, an individual must: Note: This program is only available to Colorado Springs Campus students. Please contact the Financial Aid Office for additional information about all available education funding options. For the purposes of Financial Aid, students at University of the Rockies may be eligible to apply for the following student financial aid programs: To be eligible for most types of financial aid, a student must: *Students pursuing a Graduate Certificate program are not eligible for financial aid. The total cost of attending University of the Rockies includes direct and indirect expenses. Direct expenses for students include tuition and fees. Also included in the budget are allowances for books and supplies, as well as personal and travel expenses. Students are notified of their estimated cost of attendance on their award notification, including the calculation of Expected Family Contribution (EFC) which is subtracted from the total cost of attendance. Application Deadlines and Renewal of Aid The annual application priority deadline for financial aid is June 1. Applications will be accepted after this date but may not receive priority. Financial Aid is not automatically renewed every year; the student must re-apply by completing the FAFSA and other paperwork as necessary. The Direct Master Promissory Note (MPN) is good for 10 years. The student will need to do the following to apply for Financial Aid: Cost of Attendance The Cost of Attendance represents the total amount it will cost a student to go to school, but may include more than direct costs billed by the University. This information can be found on the University website at: To select the Financial Aid Plan as the primary payment option for enrollment in a non-term program, at least 50% of a student?s annual tuition must be funded through the federal financial aid benefits. Under this plan when used as a primary payment option for enrollment in a non-term program, students are expected to submit all financial aid documents prior to their start date. If an enrolled student fails to supply all required documents by end of the first week (Monday at 12 am midnight] in the Mountain Time Zone), the student will be withdrawn from his or her current course. Students who are otherwise qualified may be rescheduled to start their program at a later date when all required financial aid documentation is submitted. If the student is unable to qualify for financial aid, he or she must select another payment option and is held responsible for any outstanding balances incurred. Continuous attendance with no attendance breaks greater than 14 days or approved breaks greater than 45 days is required to retain eligibility for disbursed federal financial aid funds. The University may schedule periods of non-enrollment during which no courses are scheduled. When this occurs, such as during the annual winter break, the non-enrollment period may extend the 14 day limit to include the break. The University may be required to return the federal funds of students with reduced financial aid eligibility due to attendance breaks, leaving the student responsible to the University for the remaining balance on the student?s account. Students who are awarded Title IV aid in an amount exceeding the tuition and fees due the University, and who withdraw before completion of the term or program, may be required to return unearned funds to the Department of Education and/or University of the Rockies. Students in this situation who received excess funds stipend checks may be required to return those funds to the institution. Students are strongly encouraged to contact their Student Advisor to understand the potential impact attendance changes may have on their financial aid as far in advance as possible. Under the Financial Aid plan for enrollment in Colorado Springs campus programs, students are expected to submit all required financial aid documents prior to the course start date. If a student is unable to qualify for financial aid, the University will update the student?s method of payment to the Cash Plan and the student will be held responsible for any outstanding balances incurred. Note: For all programs, students are required to make Satisfactory Academic Progress in order to maintain eligibility for Title IV federal financial aid. See the Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) policy in the Colorado Springs Campus, Denver Instructional Site, and Online Admissions and Academic Policies sections of this Catalog for further details related to SAP review and requirements, and information related to conditions of Academic and Financial Aid Warning, Academic and Financial Aid Probation and Probation-Academic Plans during which students maintain Title IV eligibility. On this plan, it is the student?s responsibility to reapply for funding as necessary. Students enrolled in a non-term program must reapply 90 days prior to the start of each academic year. Tardiness in applying could result in disqualification and require compliance with the terms and conditions of the Cash Plan. Students enrolled in an on-campus program are responsible for reapplying for funding each year by March 1, if they chose that method of payment. In accordance with Title IV Regulations, any student not completing the financial aid process in advance of his or her last date of attendance of the current or recently completed academic year forfeits eligibility for financial assistance that might otherwise have been available during that period of enrollment, and becomes fully responsible for all remaining balances. As a financial aid applicant or recipient, students have the following rights: As a financial aid applicant or recipient, students have the following responsibilities: Students who meet eligibility requirements may request a deferment or forbearance of their loan payment. The following are circumstances under which a student may qualify for a deferment: currently enrolled in school on at least a half-time basis; graduate fellowship; rehabilitation training; unemployment; economic hardship; military service; or post-active duty student. A borrower who has reached his or her aggregate borrowing limit may not receive additional loans. Repeating Coursework for Non-Standard Term Verification for Federal Student Aid Eligibility The student will be required to provide appropriate and legible supporting documents to the University of the Rockies Financial Aid Office. In most cases, this documentation includes the following information: Please note that additional documents may be requested at the University of the Rockies Financial Aid Office?s discretion. Participation in the verification process is not optional. If a student who is selected for verification does not submit the required documentation within 30 days, financial aid processing will be delayed, and the student may not be eligible to receive federal financial aid as a University of the Rockies student. If any changes to the student?s FAFSA or application information are needed or clarification is needed for additional documentation that maybe required, an advisor from the Financial Aid Office will contact the student. In this case, the student or parent may be required to submit additional documentation and to resubmit his or her application for financial aid to the U.S. Department of Education. If a student?s financial aid award in any way changes as a result of verification, a new award letter will be generated and emailed to the student with the updated Expected Family Contribution and award amounts, as applicable. If a student?s financial aid award in any way changes as a result of verification, a new award letter will be generated and emailed to the student with the updated Expected Family Contribution and award amounts, as applicable. Financial aid will not be processed or disbursed if an applicant fails to provide the appropriate and legible verification documentation. In addition, the University will return to the lender any applicable loan proceeds otherwise payable to the applicant. If University of the Rockies obtains any credible information indicating that an applicant for federal student financial assistance may have knowingly engaged in fraud or other criminal misconduct in connection with his or her application for federal student financial assistance, that individual will be referred to the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Education. Examples of this type of information are: Entrance and Exit Counseling Return to Title IV Funding The portion of Title IV funds a student is allowed to receive is calculated on a percentage basis by comparing the total number of days completed before the student withdrew from the program to the total number of days in the payment period. An official withdrawal date is determined when a student requests to be dropped from their program or does not meet attendance requirements to remain eligible for Title IV funding. For example, if the student withdrew on the 15th day of a payment period that has 63 days, the student has completed 24% of the payment period and has therefore earned 24% of the federal student financial aid that was disbursed or could have been disbursed. This means that 76% of the aid that was disbursed or could have been disbursed remains unearned and must be returned to the federal student financial aid program. The numerator and the denominator include weekend days but not scheduled breaks of five consecutive days or more. A student earns 100% of the aid once he or she has completed more than 60% of the term. If the amount of aid disbursed to the student is greater than the amount of aid earned by the student, the unearned portion must be returned to the federal account. In returning unearned funds, the institution is responsible for returning the portion of the excess equal to the lesser of the institutional charges for the payment period multiplied by the unearned percentage of funds, or the entire amount of excess funds. If the student is required to return any of the excess funds, then the student must repay those funds. If the excess funds consist of Title IV loans, then the student repays the loan in accordance with the terms and conditions of the promissory note. If the amount of aid disbursed to the student is less than the amount of aid earned by the student, a post-withdrawal disbursement may be available to assist the payment of any outstanding tuition and fee charges on the student?s account. The post-withdrawal disbursement will be made from Title IV grant funds before available Title IV loan funds. If a student is eligible to receive a post-withdrawal disbursement from Title IV loan funds, the student will be asked for his or her permission to disburse the loan funds on the student?s account to reduce is the balance owed to the institution or disburse the excess loan funds directly to the student. The University has 30 days from the date of the institution?s determination the student withdrew to offer the post-withdrawal disbursement of a loan to the student. The student has 14 days from the date the institution sends the notification to accept the post-withdrawal disbursement in writing. If the student accepts the post-withdrawal disbursement, the University will make payment within 180 days from the student?s withdrawal date. Once the University?s portion of the return of funds has been calculated, the Financial Aid Office will return the aid within 45 days to the appropriate federal student financial aid program(s) in the order specified below. If this creates a balance on the student?s account, the student will be responsible for full payment. A student will not be allowed to re-enter, register, or receive an official academic transcript until the outstanding balance has been paid in full. If loan funds need to be returned by the student, the student may pay these funds back under the original terms of the loan. The University will return the unearned Title IV funds in the following order: Financial Aid Guidelines for Non-Standard Term Delivery Format Week = Seven (7) calendar days Financial Aid Guidelines for Non-Term Delivery Format Week = 7 calendar days Full Academic Year Definition = a minimum of 36 weeks of instructional time and either 18 successfully earned credits of coursework or 4 successfully earned credits of thesis work that apply toward the student?s program of study. The credit requirement may be met through a combination of experiences and will be prorated as follows: 1 credit of coursework equals 1/18 of an Academic Year and 1 credit of thesis work equals 1/4 of an Academic Year. A full Academic Year consists of 2 increments that may be referenced as payment periods, financial aid payment periods, or Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) increments. Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) is evaluated at the end of each payment period. Week = 7 calendar days Full Academic Year Definition = a minimum of 36 weeks of instructional time and either 18 successfully earned credits of coursework or 6 successfully earned credits of practicum or 4 successfully earned credits of dissertation courses that apply toward the student?s program of study. The credit requirement may be met through a combination of experiences and will be prorated as follows: 1 credit of coursework equals 1/18 of an Academic Year, 1 credit of practicum equals 1/6 of an Academic Year, and 1 credit of dissertation courses equals 1/4 of an Academic Year. A full Academic Year consists of 2 increments that may be referenced as payment periods, financial aid payment periods, or Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) increments. Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) is evaluated at the end of each payment period. Loan Qualifications and Disbursement Loan periods are 36 calendar weeks in length. The beginning of the loan period will coincide with the date a student begins coursework. The first disbursement will be delivered on or after the start date of the course, depending upon completion of the financial aid paperwork. A student may receive a second loan once these conditions have been met: *Note: Once a grade of ?I? is successfully completed for a permanent grade, the course will count towards successful completion. Tuition Payment and Financial Aid Each financial aid disbursement is intended to cover tuition costs for at least 9 credits or 2 credits of thesis work at the Master?s level, or 9 credits or 3 credits of practicum or 2 credits of dissertation courses at the Doctoral level. However, students who do not meet the aforementioned criteria for receipt of loan funds may be required to pay for more than the minimum number of courses before a subsequent disbursement is available. However, the University is in no way affiliated or endorses any of these listed sites. Please beware of sites that ask for payment for scholarship information and/or applications. Scholarships (Colorado Springs Campus and Denver Instructional Site) Applicants must submit a position statement addressing their commitment to service and articulating how their degree will enhance their effectiveness in their professional role and/or participation in a professional organization or association related to the field of Organizational Development and Leadership.

Both methodological and substantive quality will be judged. The recipient will receive the $1,500 honorarium at the University of the Rockies? commencement ceremony. Students who qualify for the Alumni Tuition Grant must successfully complete three attempted courses after matriculation into a graduate degree program to remain eligible for the grant. The tuition grant will then be applied to the student?s account in the amount of tuition charged for the fourth attempted course. Students who drop or are administratively dropped from courses will have the tuition refunded according to the following schedule based on their last date of attendance. A student at the Colorado Springs Campus wishing to withdraw from a class or from the University of the Rockies must notify the Registrar's Office. The refund policy excludes all fees which will remain payable. If a student registers for a course with an associated fee and never attends the course, the fee will be refunded. Federal funds required to be returned as a result of changes in eligibility due to reduced attendance will be the responsibility of the student. Refund requirements designated by certain state agencies, where applicable, may take precedence over the institutional refund policy. Students who drop or are administratively dropped from a course (or the institution) may be eligible for a tuition refund. Return of Title IV is based on the length of the payment period. Online and Denver Instructional Site students should refer to the Non-Term Format Tuition Refund Schedule or applicable state refund policy for specific information regarding tuition refunds. Students whose last date of attendance (LDA) is during the indicated week will receive the tuition credit indicated. If a non-term student drops on or before the start date of a course, a 100% refund of the total cost of the course will be provided. Fees are nonrefundable unless otherwise noted. Federal funds required to be returned as a result of changes in eligibility due to reduced attendance will be the responsibility of the student. The amount of the refund is determined according to the following calculation: 90% ? Tuition multiplied by the fraction of (number of calendar days remaining in the course until the date equivalent to the completion of 60% of the caldendar days in the course) divided by (total number of calendar days in the course until the date equivalent to 60% of the calendar days in the course)  The University will make every effort to refund prepaid amounts for books, supplies, and other charges. A student will receive the refund within 40 days of the termination date. If a student withdraws after completing 60% of the instruction, and the withdrawal is due to mitigating circumstances beyond the student's control, the University will refund a pro rata amount. A written notice of withdrawal is not required. For students receiving funds under Title IV and Title 38, the school will comply with federal guidelines concerning constructive notice of withdrawal. All or a portion of the refund will be used to pay grants, loans, scholarships or other financial aid in conformity with federal and state law. The school will make a ""good faith"" effort to make a refund, if necessary, by sending certified mail to the student's permanent address.

Students may receive one or more types of financial aid: Scholarships, Grants, Loans, and Part-time employment. These can be awarded individually or in combination, depending on the student?s financial need and eligibility. Certain financial aid programs require financial need. Financial need is the difference between the student?s estimated Cost of Attendance for the academic year and the Expected Family Contribution (FAFSA results). The estimated Cost of Attendance includes tuition, fees, books and supplies, room and board, and estimated transportation and personal expenses. Students may not receive financial aid in excess of the cost of attendance. Financial aid offers are based on full-time enrollment (12 credit hours or more). Aid is disbursed at a prorated rate for students not enrolled full-time. Information and Assistance The Financial Aid Office staff provide assistance with the financial aid application process and financial budgeting. In addition, the student and parents may request a review of the determination of the student?s need and award. For further information regarding financial aid, contact: February 1 is the admissions application deadline to be considered for freshmen scholarships (deadline for Chattanooga Yes is April 1). Continuing and transfer students should complete the UTC Scholarship application by March 1. The UTC Scholarship application is available on the UTC?Financial Aid Forms web page. Five Steps to Financial Aid at UTC Aid is awarded based on full-time enrollment (12 credit hours or more). Enrollment status for financial aid is determined on the last day to add classes for a semester and eligibility is adjusted accordingly. Aid is awarded for the academic year, half for fall and half for spring semester. Follow these steps to accept a Stafford Loan Federal? regulation requires all students, including students not currently receiving aid, be evaluated and notified of financial aid eligibility status based on financial aid satisfactory academic progress (SAP) standards. Financial aid satisfactory academic progress is reviewed each semester when grades post. Financial aid SAP?is evaluated on the following 3 criteria: Other important things to know regarding financial aid SAP: Examples of actions that may affect a student?s financial aid SAP include but are not limited to: Drop a class, withdrawal from all classes, fail a class, change major, receive an incomplete grade, repeat a course, or change a class from credit to audit. If you have any questions about this SAP policy, please contact the Financial Aid Office. Progress standards for scholarships are detailed separately via the following means: Pell Grant awards range from $555 to $5,550 with the value of the award reflecting the Estimated Family Contribution and the number of credit hours in which the student has enrolled. The grant is the ?base? award of financial aid and is awarded before other forms of aid. Regulations and provisions of the Pell Grant Program are subject to change by Federal legislative action. Pell Grant Awards are based on full time status and are prorated based on actual number of hours attended. This grant, which ranges from $250 to $500, is available to undergraduate students with high financial need as determined by the FAFSA. Funds are limited, so it is essential that students complete the FAFSA and all other required documents as early as possible. The Academic Competitiveness Grant (ACG) is a Federal grant available to students who have completed the FAFSA, are eligible for the Pell Grant, are U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens, and graduated from high school January 1, 2005, or later. This award is given to Freshmen and Sophomore students who have completed a qualifying rigorous high school curriculum as defined by the U.S. Department of Education. Recipients must maintain a 3.0 GPA to receive the grant during the sophomore year. Awards range from $375 to $1,300 per academic year. Regulations and provisions of the ACG Grant are subject to change by Federal legislative action. Science and Mathematics Access to Retain Talent (SMART) Grant The SMART Grant is a Federal grant available to students who have completed the FAFSA, are eligible for the Pell Grant, are U.S. citizens and eligible non-citizens, and have declared one of the eligible majors as defined by the U.S. Department of Education. Students must also have a 3.0 GPA in their declared major to receive these funds. The maximum award for the academic year is $4,000. Regulations and provisions of the SMART Grant are subject to change by Federal legislative action. Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant Grants are made by the Tennessee Student Assistance Corporation to residents of the State of Tennessee who show financial need according to the FAFSA. TSAC annual awards range from $500 to $2,000. Students must apply by the February 15 deadline. The William D. Ford Federal Direct Stafford Loan program provides students with low interest student loans based on financial need as determined by the FAFSA. Most students with good academic standing and satisfactory academic progress for continuing financial aid are eligible for the Federal Stafford Loan program. There are two types of Stafford Loans: subsidized and unsubsidized. For a subsidized Stafford Loan, the interest is paid by the Federal government as long as the student is enrolled at least half-time. For an unsubsidized Stafford Loan, the student is responsible for the interest at a low government fixed rate while enrolled at least half time in college. Repayment of the loans is deferred for 6 months after a student graduates, terminates his or her education, or drops below halftime; and then the payments are structured over a 10-year repayment plan. The maximum Stafford loan amount for a dependent undergraduate (as defined by the FAFSA) in a 12-month period is $5,500 for freshmen; $6,500 for sophomores; and $7,500 for juniors and seniors. Independent students, as defined by the FAFSA, are eligible for additional unsubsidized funds in the amount of $4,000 for freshmen or sophomores, and $5,000 for a juniors or seniors. The Federal Stafford loan maximum aggregate may not exceed $31,000 for the dependent undergraduate (maximum of $23,000 subsidized) or $57,000 for the independent undergraduate or post-baccalaureate student. The Federal loan aggregate limit for Stafford Loans for graduate and professional students is $138,500. A list of recommended lenders for the Stafford loan program may be found on the UTC Financial Aid website or in the UTC Financial Aid Office. Federal Parents Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) Federal PLUS loans allow parents with good credit histories to borrow for each dependent child who is enrolled half-time or more. These loans, like Federal Stafford Loans, are made by a lender. A list of recommended lenders for the PLUS loan is available on the UTC Financial Aid website or in the UTC Financial Aid office. The yearly loan limit is the student?s cost of attendance minus any estimated financial aid the student receives. The interest rate, as set by the Federal government, will be variable but not higher than 9.0 percent. If a parent is denied a PLUS loan by a lender, the student may be eligible for an additional unsubsidized Stafford loan at the independent annual limit. Additional funds are available to students through a lender in the form of a private loan. A list of recommended lenders for private loans is available on the UTC Financial Aid website or in the UTC Financial Aid Office. Interest rates, origination fees, deferment options and terms vary by lender, so students are encouraged to comparison shop. These loans should be a student?s last resort in attempting to pay for college costs. Students who are not in good standing with the office of Financial Aid (Unsatisfactory Academic Progress) may apply for these loans as an option to cover educational expenses. The University participates in the Federal Work-Study Program administered by the U.S. Department of Education. To be eligible for the Federal Work-Study Program, a student must be accepted for admission and enrolled with good standing. A student?s eligibility is determined by the FAFSA. On-campus part-time work opportunities are available in various departments, offices, and agencies of the University. Off-campus work in community service organizations may also be available through the Federal Community Service Learning Program. Additional part-time employment opportunities, both on and off campus, are handled by the Job Location and Development Program in the Financial Aid Office. These positions are available to any student, regardless of financial need. To be eligible for this part-time employment, the student must meet the requirements established by the employing agency. The UTC Placement and Student Employment Center also provides job postings. In addition to the University?s other scholarship programs, the University provides the Chattanooga Yes Grant to students with high financial need, as defined by the FAFSA, who are residents of Tennessee and who are first-time freshmen. The University awards these grants on a first come first serve basis. The grant award reflects the applicant?s EFC, high school GPA, and ACT or SAT composite score. The grant award is $3,000 per year, to which students may add the $4,000 to $5,500 of Tennessee Lottery Scholarship funds. Scholarships are renewed for up to four years based on the student?s academic performance. Approximately 200 awards are available each year. Recipients are determined by the UTC Scholarships Committee. The application deadline is April 1. Tennessee residents who graduated from a Tennessee high school in 2003 or after may qualify for the Tennessee Education Lottery Scholarships (TELS) also called the HOPE Scholarship. Students must have graduated from high school with a 3.0 unweighted overall GPA out of a possible 4.0, or scored at least a 21 ACT (980 SAT) completing required college core courses. These funds are administered by the Tennessee Student Assistance Corporation (TSAC), and awards generally range from $4,000 to $5,500 per year. The application form for Lottery Scholarship funds is the FAFSA. The FAFSA application deadline is September 1 for Fall and February 1 for Spring/Summer. The University of Tennessee at Chattanooga must be listed first on the FAFSA to receive the student?s eligibility for the Lottery Scholarship. In the event UTC was not listed first, the student must change the FAFSA to list UTC as their first choice. Adult students, over the age of 25, who have never been enrolled in college may also be eligible for these funds. All students who believe they are eligible should check with the Financial Aid Office to receive the most up to date information as these scholarships are subject to annual changes by the State legislature. Refund Process?Return of Title IV Funds Students who receive Federal Title IV assistance will be subject to a refund calculation return if they withdraw from all classes. Students who withdraw during the first 60 percent of the term will have a refund calculated under the Return of Title IV Funds Refund Policy. The percentage of the refund will equal the percentage remaining in the term at the time that the student withdraws. All refunds caused by a student withdrawing from classes will be returned to the appropriate financial aid account(s) or lender in the case of student loans. Refunds will be credited/returned within 45 days to the appropriate student financial aid program(s) in the order listed: Note: UTC reserves the right to bill the student for any return of Title IV refund amount that exceeds the University?s published institutional refund policy. Students who receive Federal student financial assistance funds in excess of what is owed to the University (e.g. maintenance, tuition, room) may be required to repay funds to certain Title IV programs: Students who stop attending classes prior to the completion of the term should carefully read the information on unofficial withdrawals. All refund/repayment calculations are completed within 45 days of the official withdrawal date, and all funds are returned to the appropriate programs. Students may present their official withdrawal/drop forms in person to the Financial Aid Office, or do so online. Failure to withdraw officially will result in the University applying its own administrative procedures for determining the unofficial withdrawal date. The University of Tennessee at Chattanooga scholarship program for new and currently enrolled students is made possible through funds provided by the University, outside foundations, estates, private businesses, civic groups, individuals, and alumni. Most scholarships are awarded to students who demonstrate strong academic achievement and proven need for financial assistance. There are, however, many scholarships based solely on academic achievement. Unless otherwise stated, to compete for any scholarship, a student currently enrolled at UTC or a transfer student must submit a UTC Application for Scholarship. First-time freshmen must complete their Admissions application by February 1 to apply for freshmen scholarships. The deadline to receive the UTC Application for Scholarship for returning and transfer students is March 1.

With this in mind, the University offers financial aid to qualified accepted applicants. The types of financial aid available vary by student and location. The Department of Financial Aid assists a large percentage of Ottawa University students. Consideration that is fair and equitable can only be given after the student has submitted the proper application materials to determine eligibility. Students are urged to submit these materials well in advance of matriculation dates, as processing a student?s aid may require several weeks. The priority application deadline for students attending the traditional residential campus (The College) is March 15 for the following fall semester. Applying by this deadline will assure the student of consideration for all types of aid. There is no application deadline for students attending the adult campuses. Students must promptly respond to requests for additional documents and forms to allow the staff in the Department of Financial Aid time to process their aid. Federal financial aid is awarded on the basis of financial need (except for Direct unsubsidized?and PLUS Loans). When a student applies for federal student aid via the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), the information reported is used in a formula, known as the Federal Methodology (FM), established by the U.S. Congress. The FM includes factors such as taxable and nontaxable income, assets (savings, etc.), benefits (social security or unemployment insurance), and the number of family members in college and is used to calculate the expected family contribution (EFC), which is the amount the student and family are expected to contribute toward the student?s education. Students may receive a booklet describing the FM in detail by writing to: Or call 800-4-FED-AID The EFC is used in an equation to determine the student?s financial need: Cost of Attendance - Expected Family Contribution = Financial Need The EFC is instrumental in determining eligibility for certain federal and state financial aid programs. Other financial resources received (e.g. scholarships,?employer reimbursement, etc.) must be taken into consideration and may affect eligibility for federal and state aid. The Department of Financial Aid will review and modify a student?s financial aid award at any time due to changes in status; new, conflicting or incorrect information; human error; or availability of funds. Financial aid offered through the University is made in good faith but may be canceled or reduced if funds become unavailable.

888440,"Majors and Programs Colloquy for Ministers of Religion-Commissioned For the Sake of the Church Giving at Our Campuses The cost of a college education is high. Students and their families are shocked and discouraged by the published ?sticker? price of college tuition and housing. What most students and families do not know is that there is help in making a college education affordable. Financial assistance in the form of grants or scholarships is often an essential part of covering the cost of an education for many students. Financial aid comes from many sources: federal and state grants, institutional grants for merit or need, and private grants/gifts from outside sources based on prior achievements or activities (foundations, local charitable entities, and other scholarship granting entities/chapters). Public institutions grant financial assistance to about 70% of enrolled students while private institutions grant financial assistance to almost 90% of the students. The colleges and universities of the Concordia University System follow this trend . $110 million in financial aid was granted to 28,500 students during the last academic year. Registered church work students received an average of $12,400 per student. There are some important steps to keep in mind when applying to an institution for admission.

Student financial assistance at Southeastern University is provided to eligible students in the form of grants, scholarships, loans and student employment.? Procedures to be followed in applying for student aid and counseling about federal and state programs are made available by the University?s Financial Aid Office. The location of the university in central Florida provides students with many opportunities for part-time employment. The returns from such work, together with savings from summer employment and financial aid, enable many Southeastern students to work their way through college. Southeastern University suggests that a prospective student contact his/her high school guidance counselor for information about ways to finance an education.

Both undergraduate and graduate students that are not meeting quantitative and qualitative satisfactory academic progress are notified by Student Financial Services via email to their assigned SEU student email, at the end of the spring semester, for the upcoming award year. To be eligible for federal and state financial aid, a student must meet the following minimum guidelines: To be eligible for federal and state financial aid, a student must meet the following minimum guidelines: Be      eligible to enroll under the university?s academic policies.  An      undergraduate student must attain a cumulative grade point of 1.6 by the      end of the freshman year (completion of 31 hours) and a 1.8 by the end of      the sophomore year (completion of 63 hours) and maintain a 2.0 average      thereafter (see chart above).  Graduate      students must remain in good standing according to policies set forth by      Academic Policies.  A graduate      student must earn a minimum of a 3.0 cumulative GPA at all times when      enrolled in a graduate program of study.  Complete      the program of study in a time-frame not to exceed 150 percent of the      published length of the program (measured in credit hours). For example,      if the academic program length requires 120 hours, the maximum time-frame      cannot exceed 180 credit hours attempted.  SAP evaluations      are reviewed at the end of spring term each academic year. If after the end      of the academic year (or spring term, if student only attending one      semester) the student is not meeting SAP standards the student will be      placed on Financial Aid Suspension.  If an      appeal has been granted for the student, the student will be placed on an      Academic Plan. The Academic Plan will include the requirement to maintain      a 2.5 GPA for all term hours attempted, and it must be followed and      satisfied each term. Otherwise, the student is ineligible for further      federal and state aid until SAP standards are met.  Based on the information in the SAR and a complete financial aid file, the University?s Financial Aid Department will calculate the amount of Pell Grant (and other financial aid) to be awarded to the student. A Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) is a federally funded program provided for undergraduate students with exceptional financial need. Priority is given to Federal Pell Grant recipients. The amount of the grant depends on the amount of verified need (as determined by the SAR) and on the availability of federal funds provided to the institution.? A Federal Perkins Loan is a low interest loan to help pay for education costs while attending the university. These loans are for students with exceptional need and priority is given to Federal Pell Grant recipients. Repayment begins nine (9) months after a student graduates, leaves school, or drops below half-time. He or she may be allowed up to ten (10) years to repay. The amount of each payment depends upon the size of the debt and the length of the repayment period, but usually the student must pay at least $40 per month. The Federal Work-Study Program (FWSP) provides jobs for students who are eligible for financial aid and who need to earn part of their education expenses to stay in college. The salary is at least equal to the current minimum wage. The amount of the work-study award depends on the financial need (as determined by the SAR), on the amount of other aid received, and on the availability of federal funds provided to the institution. Some examples of FWSP jobs at Southeastern University include: library assistant, laboratory assistant, secretarial assistant and custodian. Federal Subsidized Stafford Loans are low interest loans made to eligible students attending a post-secondary school at least half-time. Loan funds are provided by a lender and insured by the Federal Government. While the student is attending school, the Federal Government pays the interest on the loan and defers (postpones) repayment of the principal. Maximum yearly loan amounts are $3,500 for Freshmen, $4,500 for Sophomores and $5,500 for Juniors and Seniors. The subsidized loan limit for a graduate student is $8,500 per academic year. A required origination/insurance fee is deducted by some lenders from each loan prior to disbursement to the student. Repayment of this loan begins 6 months after the student graduates, leaves school, or drops below half-time. The repayment term is normally five to ten years depending on the amount of the loan. Applications are available through the University?s Financial Aid Office.? Federal Unsubsidized (non-need based) Stafford Loans are low interest loans made to eligible independent students attending a post-secondary institution at least half-time. Loan funds are provided by a lender and insured by the Federal Government. The Federal Government does not pay the interest on this type of loan while the student is in school or in deferment. Unsubsidized borrowers are responsible for all interest beginning at disbursement. Maximum annual loan limits are $4,000 for Freshmen and Sophomores and $5,000 for Juniors and Seniors. The unsubsidized loan limit for graduate students is $10,000 per year. An origination/insurance fee is deducted by some lenders from each loan prior to disbursement to the student. Repayment of this loan can be deferred (postponed) until six months after the student graduates, leaves school, or drops below half-time status. However, as noted above, the student is responsible for all interest that accrues during the deferment period. Applications are available through the University?s Financial Aid Office. Federal Parent Loan for Undergraduate Student (Plus) Federal PLUS loans are for parents who want to borrow to help pay for their student?s education. These loans enable parents with good credit histories to borrow for each dependent child who is enrolled at least half-time. An origination/insurance fee is deducted by the lender from each loan check prior to disbursement. Interest rates are variable but will not exceed nine percent. Repayment begins immediately after disbursement of funds. Depending on the amount borrowed, parents may have up to 10 years to repay. Students should complete a FAFSA and submit a valid SAR to the University?s Financial Aid Office in order to determine the amount of the parent?s eligibility for a Federal PLUS loan.

888414,"High-Ranking Colleges and Universities Strengthen Financial Aid A large number of selective colleges and universities have beefed up their financial aid budgets. It remains to be seen if these changes will result in the admission of more low-income and black students. With huge and growing endowments high-ranking colleges and universities are facing enormous political pressure to use the earnings of these funds to increase financial aid and make higher education more affordable. Now that Congress is threatening legislation to require wealthy colleges and universities to spend more of their endowment earnings, many educational institutions have taken the initiative and added millions of dollars to their financial aid budgets. Earlier, Harvard eliminated the family contribution for students from low-income families and replaced student loans with scholarship grants. Since Harvard sweetened the financial aid pot for all but the most wealthy students, a large number of other high-ranking colleges and universities have revamped their financial aid programs in order to compete ? as best they can ? against Harvard. Yale University was first to act. It announced it would increase its financial aid budget by $22 million, providing ?need-based? aid to students from families with incomes as high as $200,000. Changes in financial aid formulas may attract more low-income applicants, a group that is disproportionately black. But it does not mean that more low-income or black students will be accepted for admission. Black students and those from low-income families will continue to face enormous obstacles in order to gain admission to these high-ranking institutions. Blacks and low-income students score significantly lower on the SAT and ACT college entrance examinations. And students from these groups tend to have lower grade point averages and lower numbers of advanced courses on their high school transcripts. So new financial aid initiatives alone will do very little to increase racial or socioeconomic diversity on the campuses of the nation?s most selective educational institutions. But it is a good start. The colleges and universities will also need to beef up their recruiting efforts in order to attract black and low-income students. Here is a rundown of some of the new financial aid initiatives that have been announced by other high-ranking colleges and universities in this academic year:"

    permanent residents. Financial aid is awarded only to students who demonstrate need. Columbia is committed to meeting
 
    the full demonstrated financial need for all applicants admitted as first-year
 
    students. Financial aid is available for all four undergraduate years, provided that students
 
    continue to demonstrate financial need. While transfer admission is need-blind, limited institutional grant aid is available for transfer students.
 
  Columbia is therefore unable to meet the full need of admitted transfer students. Columbia believes that the principal responsibility for meeting educational costs belongs to the family, and offers financial aid only to supplement the family's resources. Columbia determines the amount each family can contribute to educational costs
 
    through an evaluation of the family?s financial information. The difference between the family contribution and the total cost of attendance at Columbia
 
    (including tuition, room, board, fees, books, travel, and personal expenses) represents
 
  the student?s demonstrated need. The family contribution to the cost of attending Columbia consists of two elements:
 
    the parent contribution and the student contribution. The parent contribution
 
    is determined through an evaluation of parent income and assets, family size, the number of family members attending college, and other factors. The student contribution
 
    consists of a percentage of student assets and a minimum contribution from summer earnings. The minimum contribution from summer earnings is currently: The expected summer earnings amount is separate from the amount that students
 
  are expected to earn by working a part-time job during the academic year. Eligibility for Columbia grant aid is limited to eight terms of undergraduate
 
    study. Students must reapply for financial aid each year and be registered
 
    for a minimum of 12 points during any term for which aid is requested. Changes
 
    in the family?s circumstances?for example, increased income or a change in the
 
    number of family members attending college?will result in changes in the family
 
    contribution. In addition, the individual elements in the financial aid package may
 
    vary from year to year. The Office of Financial Aid and Educational Financing reserves the right to revise
 
    a financial aid award if the student withdraws from school or if any information
 
    reported on a financial aid application conflicts with information on tax returns or
 
    other verification documents. If a family?s financial circumstances change after
 
    submission of the financial aid application, an appeal may be made to the Office
 
    of Financial Aid and Educational Financing, in writing, for a reconsideration of
 
    the financial aid package. An appeal may be made at any time during the year if
 
    circumstances warrant; otherwise, appeals in direct response to initial award letters
 
    must be made in writing within two weeks of receipt of aid
 
  packages. Regulations for Holders of Columbia Scholarships Office of Financial Aid and
 
    Educational Financing Requirements for the
 
    Degree of Bachelor of Arts College and University Policies. Financial aid is awarded in the form of a ?package,? consisting of a combination
 
    of the various types of financial aid for which the student is eligible. Most financial
 
    aid packages include a combination of grants and ?self-help.? The self-help
 
    portion of a financial aid package is a part-time job during the academic year. Grants from government
 
    sources or directly from Columbia cover any remaining need beyond that covered
 
  by the self-help award. Columbia determines the institutional and federal financial aid programs for
 
    which each student is eligible and awards funds appropriately. In addition to applying to Columbia for assistance, all financial aid applicants are encouraged to
 
    apply for any other grant/scholarship aid for which they may be eligible. Students
 
    must notify the Office of Financial Aid and Educational Financing if any outside
 
    awards are received. Students who receive financial aid from Columbia grant permission to the
 
    Office of Financial Aid and Educational Financing to release relevant personal, academic, and financial information to persons or organizations outside Columbia
 
    in order to institute or to continue financial assistance that they might be eligible
 
    to receive from such sources. Students can expect that Columbia will respect their
 
    right to privacy and release information only as necessary. The following sources of financial aid may be included in a financial aid package
 
    from Columbia. A. Grants and Scholarships FSEOG are grants made
 
    under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, from funds
 
    entirely supplied by the federal government. These grants are awarded to students
 
    who demonstrate exceptional financial need and are made without expectation of
 
    repayment. The amount of an individual grant may range from $200 to $4,000 per
 
    year. This program is authorized by the Higher Education Act Amendments of
 
    1972. Under this program the federal government provides grants to students who
 
    qualify on the basis of financial need. Current Pell grants may range from $564 to $5,645. TAP provides grants to full-time
 
    matriculated New York State residents if the family meets financial requirements
 
    set by New York State. Current TAP awards range from $500 to $5,000. Higher Education Opportunity Program and National 
 
    Opportunity Program FWS is a program for student employment
 
    authorized by the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended. The Work Study
 
    Payroll Office is dedicated to assisting Columbia students with all processes related
 
    to hiring and payment. The Federal Work Study Program is designed to promote
 
    part-time employment for students who are in need of earnings to finance
 
    their education and to encourage participation in community service. The goal of
 
    Columbia University?s FWS program is to provide student assistance that supports
 
    a wide range of career objectives and departmental needs within the University
 
    and the community. Students who work through the work-study program are subject
 
    to the earnings limitations specified in their financial aid packages. Other student employment In addition to Columbia?s commitment to meeting 100% of every student?s
 
    demonstrated financial need, Columbia is committed to assisting families in meeting
 
    their family contributions. The following financing options are available to
 
  assist families in making educational costs more affordable. Columbia offers an interest-free payment plan through
 
    which families may make ten equal monthly payments throughout the year rather
 
    than paying the semester?s bill in full at the beginning of each term. The only cost
 
  associated with the plan is a nominal enrollment fee, and payments start in July. Parent Loans for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) Through the federal PLUS
 
    loan program, parents may borrow for a child?s educational expenses. Loans are
 
    made directly   by the federal government. Under the federal PLUS program, parents may
 
    borrow up to the total cost of attendance minus any other financial aid received.
 
    Parents need not demonstrate need to qualify; however, they must be citizens or
 
    permanent residents of the United States, must file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), and must pass a standard credit check. A
 
    fee of up to 4% is deducted from the loan at the time that it is disbursed.
 
    Repayment begins sixty days after the second disbursement of the loan. Office 
 
    of Financial Aid and Educational Financing How to Apply for Financial Aid All financial aid applicants must complete the CSS PROFILE Form, which is available on-line at www.collegeboard.com/profile. Completion of the form requires a secure browser and credit card. All students must include the Columbia
 
    University Columbia College CSS code on their PROFILE Form. The deadlines to submit on-line are: If the student?s natural parents
 
 are divorced or separated, Columbia requires each parent to provide
 
 financial information as a part of the student?s application for
 
 financial aid. The parent with whom the applicant lives most of the
 
 year should complete the PROFILE Form and the FAFSA. The noncustodial
 
 parent should submit an income tax return and the CSS Noncustodial
 
 PROFILE (on-line form provided as a link once the CSS PROFILE is
 
 submitted) to the financial aid office. The deadlines for completing
 
 this form are: Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) Students and their parents submitting the FAFSA for the first time are encouraged to request personal identification numbers (PINs) from the Federal Student Aid PIN website, www.pin.ed.gov, ahead of time, so that they may complete the FAFSA with an on-line signature. Families of continuing students who are reapplying for financial aid should use their PIN from prior years. All on-line FAFSA applicants should wait
 
    for and print out the confirmation page, to ensure that their submission
 
    has been received. Columbia recommends, if possible, filing federal income tax returns before completing the FAFSA form; however, these forms must be submitted no later than the following 
 
    deadlines: Signed copies of parent and student federal income tax returns, including W-2 forms and all schedules, are required for verification of the information reported on the PROFILE Form and FAFSA. The financial aid office strongly encourages families of first-year applicants to complete their federal income taxes in February. Once applicants have completed the CSS PROFILE they will receive an e-mail directly from the College Board, which contains an IDOC number and instructions for submitting tax documents. International students must submit their and their parents' most recently filed income tax returns, or if tax returns are not filed in their country, a statement of annual earnings. If the student or parents own all or part of a business, corporations, or partnership, or are farm tenants, a complete copy of the most recent business tax return (i.e. Form 1065, 1120, or 1120S) must be included with the tax documents sent to Columbia via the IDOC service. Sole proprietors must submit Schedule C. The preferred deadlines for submission of  all signed federal tax documents via the IDOC service are: Tax Withholding for Nonresident Alien Scholarship and Fellowship Recipients United States tax law requires the University to withhold tax at a 14% rate on scholarship and fellowship grants exceeding the cost of tuition, books,
 
  fees, and classroom expenses that are paid to nonresident aliens. Certain countries have entered into tax treaties with the United States, which may reduce this withholding rate; however, even when such a treaty applies, the student and the University must report the full amount of such excess
 
    to the Internal Revenue Service. If students claim tax treaty benefits, they must also report this amount to their country of residence. The International Students and Scholars Office The following listing of endowed scholarship funds are the cornerstone
 
    of Columbia College?s need-blind and full-funding financial aid program.
 
    These funds have been generously donated by alumni, parents and friends of the College to provide an opportunity
 
 for students of rare talent who would otherwise be unable to afford the cost of a Columbia education.
 
    More than 40% of Columbia College students receive a Columbia
 
    grant toward their demonstrated need and are thus eligible to be chosen to receive
 
  the honor of representing a designated scholarship. The commitment of alumni and loyal donors enables the college to maintain one of the most diverse and talented student bodies among our peer institutions. Alumni interested in joining in the Columbia College Scholarship

The office administers need-based financial aid programs funded by Federal, State, University, and private sources in the form of grants, Federal Direct Subsidized loans, Federal work-study programs, and both merit-based and need-based scholarships. In addition, the office administers the William D. Ford Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan program and the Federal Direct PLUS loan program, both of which are non-need-based federally-supported sources of funding. Alternative loan options are also available. Scholarships, Grants, Loans, and Student Employment The University offers a variety of awards each year to qualified students who have been accepted for admission into degree programs. Some of these awards are available only to Virginia residents, while others are awarded without regard to state residency. Student assistance is offered on the basis of scholastic achievement and/or established financial need. Financial need is defined as the difference between the cost of education/attendance at Old Dominion University and the amount of money an applicant and his or her family are expected to make available from their income and assets to meet the expenses of that education. The eligibility for non-need Federal Direct Unsubsidized loans and Federal Direct PLUS loans is determined by a combination of factors, including dependency status, student classification (undergraduate/graduate, grade level), cost of attendance, and aggregate amount borrowed to date, to name a few. To be eligible for assistance from the major student aid programs, a student must be a citizen or an eligible non-citizen. A student must be admitted and enrolled as degree seeking in an eligible program; must be registered with the Selective Service (if required); must not be in default or owe a repayment or refund on a federally guaranteed loan or grant; and must be in good academic standing (making satisfactory academic progress) to be eligible for financial assistance. Certain aid programs require a student to maintain a full-time status. There is one exception to the requirement that students be admitted on a degree-seeking basis: students who are admitted only for purposes of teacher certification may qualify for a William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan. Financial aid eligibility is determined on an annual basis, for one academic year (Fall, Spring, Summer) only, and is determined for succeeding years upon re-application and continued eligibility. Applications for Old Dominion University-administered financial aid should be submitted as early as possible in January for consideration in the following academic year. Awards are offered on a first-come, first-served basis. Priority awards of grants funded by the Commonwealth of Virginia as well as for the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) Program are awarded to eligible students whose Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is received by the federal processing agency no later than February 15 preceding the academic year of interest. To be considered for the Annual and Endowed Scholarships administered by the University, an Admissions application or the Scholarship Application for Continuing Students must be received by the University by February 15 preceding the academic year of interest. All admitted students are automatically considered. An entering student must be accepted for admission into a degree-seeking program before receiving a financial aid eligibility notification email; however, a student who has not yet been accepted for admission may apply for financial assistance. Once admitted into an eligible degree program, the student will automatically receive a notice of tentative financial aid eligibility. Announcements of financial aid eligibility for early applicants are generally made before May 1. The applicant will be notified by the Office of Student Financial Aid. In addition, the admitted student is encouraged to monitor the status of his/her application for aid and its subsequent processing by accessing his/her records on the University?s secure online site, LEO Online. Students may be notified by e-mail to their Old Dominion University e-mail accounts throughout the year. Alerts, reminders, and student-specific information are mailed through the University?s secure e-mail system throughout the year, and students are responsible for reading and responding to these communications. To be considered for financial aid, a student must complete all documents and submit them as soon as possible after January 1 preceding the academic year for which application is made. (For example, a student planning to attend during the Fall Semester, 2013 would submit a financial aid application in January, 2013.) The documents and deadlines are described below. Note: The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is required of all applicants for financial aid. Document 1: The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) Once the FAFSA is received and processed, the federal processing center will e-mail the Student Aid Report (SAR) to the applicant. Students are strongly encouraged to review and keep their SARs and all other financial-aid-related documents for future reference. The SAR contains valuable information as well as a unique data release code. Students should also keep copies of all documents used to complete the FAFSA, as they may be requested by the Office of Student Financial Aid as part of the federally-required verification process. Students who are eligible to participate in the federal work study program will be required to submit certain documents. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 requires all employees of the University to complete an Employment Eligibility Verification (Form I-9). Student employees who wish to work on or off campus must be prepared to complete the I-9 Form before they begin working. The I-9 Form cannot be completed unless the employee provides documents to verify both identity and employment eligibility. The following documents will satisfy this requirement: If one of the previously referenced documents is not available, an applicant or employee must submit both a document verifying employment eligibility and a document establishing identity. Documents that verify employment eligibility include: Documents establishing identity include: Document 4: Consortium Agreement and Dual Enrollment Forms Students attending classes at a distant site may be required to submit these forms. These students should consult with their site director and their financial aid counselor to determine if these forms are required. Satisfactory Academic Progress for Financial Aid Eligibility Maintaining Satisfactory Academic Progress is one of many federally mandated criteria viewed in determining a student?s eligibility for continued receipt of financial aid. Progress is measured by PACE (the number of credits earned in relation to those attempted), Qualitative (GPA) standard and Allowable time (the maximum time frame allowed to complete the academic program). Students must also demonstrate a progression toward completion of their degree program within an established timeframe. Failure to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress will result in loss of financial aid eligibility. Progress is reviewed annually, at the end of the academic year. In order to maintain financial aid eligibility, an undergraduate student is required to complete 67% of the total credit hours attempted. How to calculate PACE: Qualitative Satisfactory Academic Progress for students is evaluated in accordance with the following: The maximum allowable time to be eligible for most financial aid programs for a full time undergraduate student is five years or 10 semesters. Students attending less than full-time will be eligible for aid for semesters registered, not to exceed the equivalent of 10 full-time semesters. Undergraduate students at Old Dominion University may attempt a maximum of 180 credit hours. Undergraduates working on a second degree will be given an additional 90 hours to earn their second degree. Note: Transfer credits are included. The Office of Student Financial Aid will conduct a review of Satisfactory Academic Progress at the end of each academic year. Email notifications of Satisfactory Academic Progress standard(s) not met will be sent to the student?s ODU email account. Please note that students who have not received financial aid in previous years but are applying for financial assistance for the first time will also be held to the requirement of maintaining Satisfactory Academic Progress. Satisfactory Academic Progress is reviewed for all semesters of a student?s enrollment regardless of whether the student was eligible for financial assistance during a term. If students exceed the maximum allowable time, they are not meeting Satisfactory Academic Progress; thus, all aid will be suspended. Financial Aid suspension does not prohibit students from continuing their education at Old Dominion University. It does prohibit students from receiving financial aid until they again meet the standards for Satisfactory Academic Progress. Students who fail to meet Satisfactory Academic Progress are placed on financial aid suspension. Students have the option to appeal this suspension. An appeal must be based on significant mitigating circumstances that seriously affected academic performance. The decision of the appeal will be sent via email to the student?s ODU email account. Note: Please make sure the student email account is activated. For students who are successful in their appeal, aid will be reinstated; however, the student will be placed on probation for one payment period/term. Emails will be sent to students on financial aid probation advising them of the conditions needed. At the conclusion of the probation term, the student must be meeting the University?s Satisfactory Academic Progress standard in order to qualify for further Title IV Funding. If it is determined that a student will need more than one probationary term, the student must be placed on an academic plan.? An academic plan will be developed by the student and their academic advisor. All academic plans will be monitored each term. If the student fails to meet the standards set up in the plan, the student will no longer be eligible for financial aid until the student establishes eligibility on their own. Students who fail to meet the conditions outlined in their academic plans during their probationary semester will not be eligible to submit a subsequent appeal. The basis for an appeal includes: Appeals will NOT be accepted for the following conditions: 1)??? Encountering a situation that could have been anticipated, such as the need to have transportation, the need to pay for ordinary living expenses, the need for child care, etc; 2)????Change of major 3)????Dissatisfaction with course material, instructor, instructional method, or class intensity 4)????Lack of motivation, change in academic interest? Directions for filing an appeal for reinstatement of eligibility for financial aid are as follows: ??? NOTE: If the appeal is submitted without the advisor or dean?s evaluation, it will not be considered. 3. Students should submit the complete appeal packet and all supporting documents within 14 days of receipt of notification. Failure?to submit the complete packet will result in cancellation of aid. Allow two weeks for the review of the appeal and receipt of the decision notification. If the appeal is approved, the decision notification will outline the conditions of the student?s contract for reinstatement of aid eligibility. The contract is binding and academic progress will be reviewed at the end of the enrollment period specified. If the appeal is denied, the decision notification will specify the conditions for future consideration for financial aid eligibility. The decision of the financial aid review committee is FINAL and cannot be appealed. If the appeal is unsuccessful, an email notification will be sent notifying students of the decision and informing them how to re-establish eligibility if applicable. Students may re-establish their eligibility for financial assistance by achieving the satisfactory progress standards. This will be at students? expense as they are ineligible for financial aid. Sitting out a semester at Old Dominion University will not assist in re-establishing eligibility. Once students have earned the required grade point average or completed the required credit hours, they must contact the Office of Financial Aid to request the reinstatement of their financial aid eligibility. Students not making Satisfactory Academic Progress at the end of the second year, but at the end of the subsequent grading period, come into compliance with the University?s graduation requirements; they will be considered to be making Satisfactory Academic Progress beginning with the next grading period. Withdrawing from Courses Withdrawing from courses may impact financial aid awards. Before withdrawing from class, students should contact the Financial Aid Office to determine the consequences. Withdrawing from the University Students who totally withdraw from the University and receive aid may owe the University money. Before withdrawing from the University, students should contact the Financial Aid Office to determine the consequences. Withdrawing from all courses for two consecutive semesters may result in loss of financial aid eligibility. Transfer and Repeat Coursework Accepted transfer credits must count as both attempted and completed hours. Repeated coursework will count toward enrollment status when there is no more than one repetition of a previously passed course or any repetition of a previously passed course due to the student failing other coursework in a prior term. Students must submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to determine eligibility for all of the following federal financial aid programs. A Federal Pell Grant, unlike a loan, does not have to be repaid. Pell Grants are only awarded to undergraduate students who have not earned a bachelor?s degree. For many students, Pell Grants provide a foundation of financial aid to which other aid may be added. The amount of Federal Pell Grants students may receive over their lifetime is limited to an equivalent of?six-years of Pell Grant funding. Like the Federal Pell Grant, this award assists undergraduate students only and does not have to be repaid. This grant is made to students who demonstrate exceptional financial need (very low expected family contribution, or EFC). Students who meet all other eligibility criteria and whose FAFSAs were received by the federal processing agency by the priority deadline (February 15) are considered for this grant. It is awarded on a first-come, first-served basis. Federal funding for this program is extremely limited. Contact the Career Management Center at (757) 683-4388 for?information on completing the application process.? This low-interest (5 percent) loan is targeted for students with exceptional financial need. A Federal Perkins Loan borrower is not charged an origination fee or an insurance premium. A Federal Perkins Loan must be repaid. Old Dominion University participates in the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program and thus receives loan funds directly from the U.S. Department of Education upon disbursement (payment) to eligible students. There are three kinds of loans: The federal government will pay the interest on these loans while students are in school and during deferments (postponements of repayment). Students must demonstrate financial need to receive this type of loan.?Only undergraduate?students?may be eligible and must be enrolled at least half time. Like all other forms of aid, loans are disbursed to student accounts on a semester-by-semester basis, and eligibility must be re-confirmed prior to release. Loans are available to eligible students regardless of financial need, but students will be required to pay all interest charges, including the interest that accumulates during deferments. The Federal Direct Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) This is available for parents of dependent students who filed the FAFSA and who meet other general eligibility requirements. Applications for this loan must be obtained through the Office of Student Financial Aid. They are not automatically offered but are available upon the written request of the parent borrower. Parents are responsible for all interest charges. PLUS Loan applications are subject to credit approval. In order to be eligible for a Commonwealth award, a student must be admitted into a Virginia public two or four year college or university, a domiciliary resident of Virginia as defined by the Code of Virginia 23-7.4, demonstrate financial need as determined by the institution (FAFSA required), be enrolled at least half-time in an eligible baccalaureate program, a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen, and otherwise eligible for federal financial aid. This is a grant and does not have to be repaid. The actual awards vary by institution and are based on funds available. The awards may not exceed tuition and required fees. Additional restrictions, such as minimum GPA or maximum hours attempted, affecting state grant eligibility may be enacted during the period covered by this catalog. In order to be eligible for a VGAP award, a student must meet all the Commonwealth award requirements, and must also be a graduate of a Virginia high school, have a minimum cumulative high school grade point average of 2.5 on a 4.0 scale, and be classified as a dependent student for federal financial aid purposes. A student generally enters the VGAP program as a freshman. Renewal of the VGAP grant is dependent upon several factors, including a minimum 2.0 GPA each semester, completion of a minimum of 12 hours each semester (full-time completion), early FAFSA filing, demonstrated financial need, and continuous full-time enrollment (minimum 12 credit hours per semester) from year to year (summer excluded). As with all other aid programs, audited courses do not count toward full-time enrollment. Participation in the VGAP program is limited to the first four years of attendance (fall/spring enrollment for four consecutive academic years). Additional restrictions, such as minimum GPA or maximum hours attempted, affecting state grant eligibility may be enacted during the period covered by this catalog. Conditions for Disbursement of Financial Aid All entering fall freshmen and transfer students who submit their admission application and ALL required credentials by the scholarship application priority deadline (December 1) are considered for merit-based scholarships offered through the Old Dominion University Office of Admissions. The admissions application serves as the merit-based scholarship application. Information related to scholarship criteria can be found on the Admissions web site. Annual and Endowed University Scholarships Scholarships at Old Dominion University have been established through the generosity of individuals, organizations and corporations to recognize outstanding academic performance and to assist students in pursuing their educational goals. Scholarship awards are based on a variety of criteria. For some awards, eligibility is entirely determined by academic merit or potential. Other requirements might include demonstrated financial need, field of study, state or city residency, graduation from a particular high school or participation in a specific program, organization or activity. Generally, recipients have earned at least a 3.4 grade point average (on a 4.00 scale) and are full-time, degree-seeking students. All first-time freshmen and transfer students will automatically be considered for academic and endowed scholarships based on their admissions application. The majority of scholarships offered to Old Dominion University students are based on information already known to the University. Selection procedures vary for these awards. All scholarships require admission to and enrollment in a degree program at Old Dominion University. For some scholarships, a portfolio, an audition or participation in a specific program may be required. A (+) denotes that graduate students are eligible for scholarships. The additional steps, if required, are summarized following each scholarship description. Students will receive written notification of any scholarship for which they have been selected. Most scholarships will be awarded in April and May of each year. All scholarships must be formally accepted in writing.

Failure to comply with the conditions of a financial award will cause its termination and the return of any unexpended funds as well as repayment, in some cases, of funds already utilized. Undergraduate-specific endowed scholarships will be withdrawn immediately for?the term in?which an?undergraduate student?advances to an admitted?graduate student?status.

There are many types of financial aid available to help manage the cost of your education, such as grants, loans, work-study opportunities, and scholarships. 2014-2015 FAFSAs and Checklist Items If you have already?completed your 2014-2015 FAFSA,?you may have items assigned to your checklist?for the 2014-2015 year.? When completing checklist documentation be sure to verify that you?have the correct form for the correct year.? Links included in the checklist?will direct you to the correct year's forms if copied and pasted into your web browser. Be careful when manually typing any links, if you had completed the form for the?previous year, your browser may try to direct you to an incorrect link. Also at this point in time, some checklist items, such as 2013 Tax Return Transcripts, may not be available if you have not completed your tax return. Tax Return Transcripts will?not be available for a few weeks after the submission of a tax return.? About my Award About my Award Who has received an award letter?  Any first-time freshmen, new to attending NIU should have had an initial award letter sent beginning March 14, 2014 if their financial aid record is complete for the 2014-2015 award year. Undergraduate students who are transferring to NIU from another institution will have their award letters sent out beginning March 22, 2014. Continuing, Graduate and Law students? award letters will be sent out starting the week of March 31, 2014. I?m a (First-time Freshman/Transferring Undergraduate/Continuing/Graduate/Law) student and it is more than 5 days after award letters have been sent out but I haven?t I received my award letter yet?  There are several reasons why you may not have received your award letter at this point in time: What is considered in offering an award?  Financial aid awards are determined based on the information provided in the 2014-2015 FAFSA. Before offering an award the information must be verified to be accurate for students who have been selected for verification. Additionally the award is offered assuming a student will be enrolled full time for the entire academic year. Any changes to enrollment status may affect the amount of financial aid a student is eligible to receive. Please contact the Student Financial Aid Office if you have any questions about how your enrollment status may affect your financial aid eligibility. About the Summer About the Summer I wish to attend Summer classes, how come I have received my award letter for the 2014-2015 year but have not received anything for the Summer term yet? Financial aid for the Summer 2014 term will not be awarded until students have registered for Summer classes. Registration for summer classes begins April 7, 2014. The Summer 2014 semester is considered a part of the 2013-2014 award year. Any financial aid available for the Summer semester will be dependent on the amount of financial aid received during the Fall 2013 and Spring 2014 semesters. Students who have exhausted their financial aid eligibility for Pell and Stafford loans may need to apply for Parent PLUS Loans (if a dependent student) or Private loans to help cover any costs associated with the Summer 2014 term. Reminder in order to be eligible to receive disbursements of loans, a student typically needs to be enrolled at least half time (3 credits for the Summer 2014 term). When can I begin registering for the Summer 2014 term? Registration for the Summer 2014 semester occurs at the same time as registration for the Fall 2014 term, April 7, 2014. I will be attending classes in the Summer 2014 and would like to take out a PLUS loan, which option should I choose for my loan period? When will Summer 2014 funds disburse??  How long will it take for submitted documents?or loan applications?to be processed? If you or your parents have applied for a PLUS Loan online, you should expect the resulting loan amount to be visible on your awards screen within roughly a week. Private Loans will take at least two weeks, due to the federal Truth In Lending Act.?  Why did my?financial aid amounts?adjust? Eligibility for the full amount of the Federal Pell Grant and/or Illinois MAP Grant is contingent on enrollment in a certain amount of credit hours (12 credit hours for Pell, 15 credit hours for MAP). When initially packaging a student with these awards, we assume that the student will be enrolled in?enough hours to qualify for the full amount. Recipients who are enrolled in fewer hours?will receive adjusted, lower?amounts of these awards. At various points prior to disbursement, the Student Financial Aid Office reviews a student's current hours of?enrollment and adjusts these awards accordingly. This is considered the best practice?in order to ensure that?students have the most accurate information?about their pending aid?at any given time. The Department of Education requires schools participating in the Title IV federal aid program to periodically adjust student budgets based on their level of enrollment; i.e. full-time, half-time and less than half-time.? If your Cost of Attendance changed, it is most likely the result of the amount of hours you are enrolled in for the term.  How do I accept my student loans? Work-Study awards are not guaranteed and are earned as wages by working on and off campus with eligible employers.? A Work-Study award reflects the amount the student can earn if hired.? Students must apply for a work-study job and be hired in order to utilize the eligibility offered on their award notification.? Work-Study wages do not credit to the student's Bursar account.? Students earn paychecks for work performed.? Regular Student Employment positions do not require an offering of Federal Work-Study on the award notification.  What is the EFC? The information supplied on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is used by the federal government to determine a student's Expected Family Contribution (EFC).? The EFC defines for the university what financial aid programs a student is eligible to participate in and the amount for which he/she is eligible.? A common misunderstanding is that the EFC is the amount? the student will owe the university.? Rather, the amount owed is the student charges minus the financial aid awarded and disbursed.?  Where should I send the check for a private scholarship I have been awarded? All scholarship checks should be sent to the Student Financial Aid office and will be directly applied to your Bursar account, one-half in the fall semester and one-half in the spring semester, unless otherwise specified by the donor.? If the check needs your endorsement, please sign before mailing.  How does my parent apply for the Parent PLUS Loan?  When should my parents apply for the Parent PLUS Loan? When a parent applies for the Parent PLUS loan the Department of Education performs a credit check to determine if the parent will be eligible to receive the Parent PLUS loan. Credit checks expire in 90 days if a Parent PLUS loan has not been created. It is recommended that parents do not apply for Parent PLUS loans for the 2014-2015 award year until May to ensure that the credit check is still valid.  What is the difference between subsidized and unsubsidized loans? The subsidized loan is based on financial need, while students qualify for the unsubsidized loan regardless of financial need.? Students eligible to borrow subsidized loans are not charged interest on the loans while they are enrolled at least half-time.? Interest on?unsubsidized loans begins accruing?while they are enrolled in school.? Students may choose to defer the interest payment on an unsubsidized loan until they begin repayment.  Where do I go for assistance with choosing a Private Student Loan?  I received an email about Title IV Authorization, what does this email mean? Federal financial aid funds may only be used to cover certain charges associated with tuition, room and board, and books. In order for Title IV funds to be able to pay other charges you must provide your authorization to use any excess funds. Title IV funds can never be used to cover prior year charges or non-education related charges such as parking tickets, fines and/or recreation charges.
