Institute on City Design is a National Endowment for the Arts leadership initiative in partnership with the American Architectural Foundation and the United States Conference of Mayors. Since 1986, MICD has helped transform communities through design by preparing mayors to be the chief urban designers of their cities. More than 850 mayors nationwide have participated in the program. To advance public interest and education in design and architecture, the American Architectural Foundation and the Chicago Architecture Foundation established the Architecture + Design Education Network. A+DEN is a collaborative association of like-minded organizations committed to promoting innovative architecture and design education for teachers and students in grades K-12. Accent on Architecture Gala Accent on Architecture Gala For the past twenty-three years, national leaders in design, government, and education have gathered in Washington, DC, for this black-tie event hosted by the American Architectural Foundation. With a program rich in ideas, the Gala has become the nation?s premier celebration of leadership in architecture and urban design. The 24th-annual Gala took place on March 22, 2013, at the historic Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium. Accent on Architecture Grants Accent on Architecture Grants AAF?s Accent on Architecture grants assist local, non-profit organizations in producing innovative design-education programs for children. Accent grants have supported creative programming initiatives including television programs, symposia, design workshops, and teacher education. They enhance the visibility and public understanding of architecture and strengthen relationships between communities and local design groups. Presented by the American Architectural Foundation, the Keystone Award is an annual national award that honors an individual or organization from outside the field of architecture for exemplary leadership that increases the value of architecture and design in our culture. NYC Planning Commissioner Amanda Burden was honored as the tenth Keystone laureate in 2011. Joseph P. Riley Jr. Award for Leadership in Urban Design Joseph P. Riley Jr. Award for Leadership in Urban Design In 2010, the American Architectural Foundation and the United States Conference of Mayors created the Joseph P. Riley Jr. Award for Leadership in Urban Design to recognize mayors whose commitment to excellence in urban design reflects the outstanding example set by the award?s namesake. The inaugural Riley Award went to former Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley in 2011. Since 1990, the Richard Morris Hunt Fellowship, co-sponsored by the American Architectural Foundation and the French Heritage Society, has offered mid-career American and French design professionals an intensive six-month exchange experience that showcases the latest scholarship and practice around historic preservation and architectural heritage. The Hunt Fellowship is named for Richard Morris Hunt, the first American architect to study at Paris? renowned ?cole des Beaux-Arts. Design for Learning Design for Learning An initiative to develop and advance knowledge, strategies, and solutions for supporting new modes of teaching and learning through architecture and design. At the heart of this initiative is the Design for Learning Council, which AAF is in the process of establishing. The Council is being formed through an invitation-only process, and it will be composed of an influential cross-section of leaders in education, technology, philanthropy, and design. Great Schools by Design Great Schools by Design Each day across the United States, more than 59 million students, teachers, and education employees spend substantial time in our country?s 120,000 school buildings. AAF established Great Schools by Design in 2005 with the belief that a well-designed learning environment is an important, perhaps essential, contributor to successful teaching and improved learning. By promoting collaboration, excellence, and innovation in school design, AAF seeks to improve the quality of America?s schools and the communities they serve. The award is named for the late George M. White, FAIA, retired architect of the Capitol, who, during his nearly 25-year tenure, oversaw key construction and restoration projects around the nation?s capital. On Thursday, October 11, 2012, the American Architectural Foundation (AAF) honored David M. Childs, FAIA, as the inaugural recipient of the George M. White Award for Excellence in Public Architecture at the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C.", "id": 999236}, {"text": "Awards and Fellowships Why I Donate How can I help fund the GIA Program? Gus Archie was a graduate of the University of Wisconsin with degrees in both mining and electrical engineering. His professional career was spent with Shell Oil Company where, as a scientist, engineer, and administrator, he contributed significantly to the science and technology of the oil industry. Archie is perhaps best known for his contributions to petrophysics. The prototype equation relating rock porosity to various electrical properties of rock bears his name: Archie?s equation. He played the key role in identification of producible horizons at the giant Elk City Field in Oklahoma, an episode which dramatically demonstrated for the first time the role that well log measurements could play in identifying pay zones. Archie was a very modest and unpretentious man, yet wielded considerable influence in his choice of staff to work with and for him. Many of these people went on, on their own, to make major contributions in their own way in development geology, reservoir engineering, as well as petrophysics. He had a remarkably good feeling for working with the earth and recognizing others who could improve our understanding of it.  The Gustavus E. Archie Memorial International Grant is awarded to two deserving graduate students enrolled in a school outside the U.S., for study of petrophysics and/or development geology of an area outside the U.S., through the American Association of Petroleum Geologists Grants-in-Aid program. It is endowed by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists Foundation, through generous contributions from Dr. and Mrs. Robert M. Sneider, Shell Oil Company and numerous other friends and associates. Support the AAPG Foundation!

Hugh Miser was born in Pea Ridge, Arkansas, and attended college at the University of Arkansas where he received Bachelor?s and Master?s degrees in geology in 1908 and 1912 respectively. While a graduate student, he began working for the United States Geological Survey and spent his entire career there, with the exception of brief leaves of absence during which he taught for a year at the University of Arkansas and later served for a year as the state geologist of Tennessee. As chief of the fuels branch of the USGS from 1928 to 1947, his geologic interests were both nationwide and international. His love, however, remained the areas of Arkansas and Oklahoma where he had roots. He was instrumental in producing the first geologic maps of both Arkansas and Oklahoma.

The program is intended to encourage students to explore interpretive careers in art museums, whether as future museum educators or curators; to strengthen the profession of museum educator within the art museum community; to strengthen ties between museum educators and curators in the shared task of interpretive programming in art museums; and to expand the range of promising career options available to students of art history and related fields. Successful interpretive programs in art museums require formal education in art history, understanding of learning theory, and sensitivity to the learning needs and styles of widely diverse audiences.? Within a mentoring environment, the Kress Interpretive Fellow develops the first-hand experience, expertise, and confidence on which to base an interpretive career in art museums, whether as museum curator or museum educator. Kress Interpretive Fellowships provide competitive grants to American art museums which sponsor supervised internships in art museum education. Preference is given to institutional applications that will provide fellows with an opportunity to collaborate closely with both art museum educators and curators, and will advance the appreciation of European art history of the pre-modern era. A minimum of?six (6)?Kress Interpretive Fellowships are awarded each year to American art museums for 9-12 month professional development opportunities. Typically, Interpretive Fellowships begin in late summer or early fall. The Fellowship award is $30,000, with a minimum of $25,000 reserved for the Fellow?s stipend and up to $5,000 available to support health, travel and other benefits for the Fellow and/or to defray the direct costs of hosting the Fellow. A final report will be due from the host institution approximately one month after the completion of the fellowship. (see Reporting and Other Requirements in the Application Guidelines). Application must be made by the art museum proposing to host a Kress Interpretive Fellow. These Interpretive Fellowships are intended as an opportunity for individuals who have completed a degree (B.A., M.A., or Ph.D.) in art history, art education, studio art or museum studies and who are pursuing or contemplating graduate study or professional placement in these or related fields. The appropriate level of educational achievement will be determined by the host museum and be dependent upon the needs of the proposed fellowship project.

At the crossroads?of science and art, the fields of conservation and technical art history demand a complex knowledge of chemistry and materials and an extraordinary sensitivity to artistic intent, as well as physical dexterity, patience, and powers of concentration. Initial training, typically at one of a handful of institutions in North America, provides basic qualifications that must be supplemented with an extended period of specialized concentration on paintings, objects, textiles, antiquities, ethnic materials, photographs, prints and drawings, books and manuscripts, furniture, etc. Within a supervised environment, the young conservator develops the specific skills, the hands-on experience, and the confidence on which to base a future career. The Kress Conservation Fellowships provide competitive grants to museums and other conservation facilities which sponsor supervised internships in the conservation of specific objects and onsite training. Nine $32,000 Fellowships are expected to be awarded each year for one-year post-graduate internships in advanced conservation at a museum or conservation facility. Typically, $27,000 is allocated as a fellowship stipend, and $5,000 toward host institution administrative costs, benefits for the Fellow, and other direct costs of hosting the Fellowship. Most Fellowships begin in late summer or early fall, and run for a term of 9 to 12 months. Applications must be made by the museum or conservation facility at which the?fellowship will be based. Prior to beginning the fellowship, fellows should have completed a masters-level degree in conservation. The fellowship candidate may be identified in advance of application by the host institution or recruited subsequently.

Given that, the Law School recognizes that many students do not have the immediate financial resources to cover the substantial costs of a legal education. Therefore, we are committed to providing a comprehensive financial aid program designed to enable any accepted student to attend the Law School and complete their degree program regardless of financial need. The Office of Financial Aid administers a number of programs to assist both prospective and continuing law students in financing their Northwestern Law education. Aid packages are composed of a combination of loans, grants, and/or scholarships. Assistance is based on demonstrated financial need. Our goal is to help students and their families develop a realistic and cost-effective plan to finance their legal education. More than 80 percent of Northwestern Law students receive some form of financial assistance, including loan packages, from the Law School. We encourage students to educate themselves about the costs and financial aid procedures. Students should start their financial aid application process as early as possible and not wait for an admissions decision before applying.

You never rowed crew in your life before this year, but by now you and your friends on the novice team are getting to be pretty good at it. There's a slight drizzle this morning (after all, this is England!), but it doesn't dampen the team's spirits, and the practice is a good one. Following practice and breakfast, it's time for a lecture in The World in Britain seminar. Mr. Christopher Hardman, a member of Reading's English department, is talking about Shakespeare's Richard III, a play you will see tomorrow on a day trip to Shakespeare's Globe in London with your classmates. You will be groundlings for the performance. After a break, you have a tutorial in art history. The tutorial method of teaching, fashioned after the style of pedagogy practiced at Cambridge and Oxford, puts you and two or three other students together with a tutor (professor) who doesn't lecture but, rather, facilitates and guides the discussion. The topic for the day is Gothic church architecture?fan vaulting, perpendicular style, and flying buttresses. During an upcoming weekend field trip, you will get to see such superb examples as Bath Abbey and Bristol Cathedral. After lunch in your house with some of your friends, you board the fast train to London. Twenty minutes later, you're at Paddington Station. Catching the tube to Covent Garden, you purchase tickets for next month's performance of Swan Lake by The Royal Ballet, then head for the theatre district for a performance of Wicked. It's a wonderful evening! Humming \"Defying Gravity,\" you head back to Paddington to catch the last train home. Sound like an interesting way to spend a day? How about a semester or a whole academic year? This is what Randolph College Abroad: The World in Britain, affiliated with the University of Reading, is all about. About the Program Since 1968, Randolph College has provided a program of study at the University of Reading, England. As many as 35 students from Randolph College and a variety of other American colleges and universities can participate at any one time. Students have often told us the Reading Program has been a life-changing experience. You will earn a minimum of 15 academic credits per semester in a broad range of courses. Think an experience like this is beyond your reach? We can help you arrange for it. Tuition and room and board costs are the same as for a semester or year on our Lynchburg campus, and your Randolph College financial aid applies to this program as well. Students attending other colleges and universities who wish to apply to the program have access to both merit and other need-based scholarships and grants. Admission is competitive but within your grasp if you are a dedicated student. So start planning for your year abroad as soon as possible. Students from many other U.S. institutions have joined our program in recent years.

The information submitted on the application form is reviewed and scored by the Research Administration Committee (RAC) in the following manner with a maximum score of 100:  Points on the Point Scale Note that this table is intended to be illustrative and may not match a particular academic institution?s grading and/or point scale. For instance, some academic institutions award grades of ?A+? for exceptional performance and translate this grade to a value of 4.33 on the point scale. To calculate a grade point average (GPA) for a number of courses, the number of points on the point scale achieved in each course is multiplied by the number of credits assigned to that particular course. The GPA is then calculated by adding the product of ?points ? credits? for each course and dividing by the total number of credits for those courses.

My legal practice focuses on the arenas of class actions, automobile dealership fraud, automobile defects/lemon law and criminal defense. I pride myself in having helped hundreds of clients and having recovered millions of dollars on their behalf. But like many, I too come from a humble beginning. At the age of thirteen I spoke poor English and failed my first pop-quiz because I did not understand what I was being asked. Since then, I earned my way through education ? graduating valedictorian, attending USC on a full scholarship, conducting gene therapy research, publishing in scholarly journals, attending USC law school, running multiple student, charitable and professional associations, founding several business ventures and building a legal career and reputation that is an embodiment of my past. And so it is with all those experiences in mind that I chose to start what is becoming an annual scholarship fund to help those taking the same path. Not necessarily the path to becoming an attorney, but the path to bettering themselves with a clear vision for their future, while staying true to their past.

Dissertations with no relevance to understanding human violence and aggression will not be supported. Priority will also be given to areas and methodologies not receiving adequate attention and support from other funding sources. These grants are made to Ph.D. candidates who are entering the dissertation stage of graduate school. Usually, this means that fieldwork or other research is complete and writing has begun. If analysis and writing are not far enough along for an applicant to be confident that he will complete the dissertation within the year, he should not apply, as the application will not be competitive with those that comply with this timetable. In some disciplines, particularly experimental fields, research and writing can reasonably be expected to be completed within the same year, and in those cases it is appropriate to apply. Recipients of the dissertation fellowship must submit a copy of the dissertation, approved and accepted by their institution, within six months after the end of the award year. Any papers, books, articles, or other publications based on the research should also be sent to the foundation. Applications are submitted online. (However, we will still accept a mailed application using our previous application method, a printable PDF form, provided it arrives at the foundation?s office no later than February 1, or the following Monday if February 1 falls on a weekend.)

Since its inception, more than 350 scholars from over 20 countries have been named Marcus Center Fellows. The Marcus Center's Fellowship Program was founded with the intent of creating a forum where students and scholars of the American Jewish experience could gather together to research, discuss, and study their chosen topics. Under the auspices of this unique program scholars come to Cincinnati to conduct in-depth research at the American Jewish Archives and to take part in the academic community of the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion. The program provides fellows with an opportunity not only to pursue their own research, but also to interact and exchange ideas with research peers as well as with the faculty and students of HUC-JIR. Today, The Marcus Center administers fifteen endowed fellowships, all funded by generous friends and supporters of the American Jewish Archives. Marcus Center fellows are teachers, students, scholars, and practitioners who, both individually and as a group, come to the American Jewish Archives to study some aspect of the American Jewish past. It is The Marcus Center's hope that this Fellowship Program will advance our understanding of American Jewish history and, simultaneously, of the American nation as a whole. Call for Applications The Jacob Rader Marcus Center of the American Jewish Archives is pleased to invite applications to its annual Fellowship Program for the 2014-2015 academic year. The Marcus Center's Fellowship Program provides recipients with month long fellowships for research and writing at The Jacob Rader Marcus Center of the American Jewish Archives, located on the Cincinnati campus of the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion. Fellowship stipends will be sufficient to cover transportation and living expenses while in residence in Cincinnati. Applicants for the Marcus Center Fellowship Program must be conducting serious research in some area relating to the history of North American Jewry. Typically, Marcus Center Fellowships will be awarded to post-doctoral candidates, Ph.D. candidates who are completing dissertations, and senior or independent scholars. Applicants must submit a fellowship application (see below) together with a five-page (maximum) research proposal that outlines the scope of their project and lists those collections at the American Jewish Archives that are crucial to their research. Applicants should also submit two letters of support, preferably from academic colleagues. For graduate and doctoral students, one of these two letters must be from their dissertation advisor. The American Council for Judaism Fellowship The American Council for Judaism Fellowship at The Jacob Rader Marcus Center of the American Jewish Archives was established in 2011 by the American Council for Judaism, Inc. (ACJ). The Council is a national organization that promotes the spiritual, intellectual and societal obligations of the Jewish religion, as well as the civic duties and responsibilities that are incumbent on all citizens of the United States. The ACJ was formally established in 1943 by a group of Reform rabbis and lay leaders who were committed to the full integration and equality of peoples of all faiths and heritages in all lands; and preserving the ideals of Reform Judaism as articulated in the Pittsburgh Platform of 1885. Since its founding, the ACJ has been dedicated to the advancement of Judaism as a religion of universal and prophetic values, consonant with the ideals of a democratic society. The core belief of the Council is that we are Americans of the Jewish faith; America is our homeland and Judaism our religion. Israel represents the founding geographic location and historical context of our religion, not our homeland or political allegiance. The Council is committed to maintaining a diversity of expression within the Jewish community and that no group, organization or nation can speak for all Jews. Over the years, the ACJ has consistently advocated on behalf of the ideals of the Classical Reform tradition in Judaism through the development of a religious school curriculum, an alternative Philanthropic Fund, use of the Union Prayer Book, and encouraging congregational worship for Classical Reform constituencies. The Council provided significant funding for the establishment of an independent Society for Classical Reform Judaism. The American Council for Judaism Fellowship supports scholarly historical research in a wide variety of areas that relate to the organization's core interests: historical perspectives on the American Council for Judaism; the history of American Reform Judaism; the interrelationships and integration of Jewish ideals and a democratic society; the historical development of the concept of Americans of the Jewish faith and its coequal relationship with all faiths in America; and the historical study of Classical Reform Judaism. Above all, the ACJ Fellowship supports the work of scholars who are pursuing critical and scientific research that promises to deepen our understanding of the history and development of American Judaism and the American Jewish experience. The Marguerite R. Jacobs Memorial Fellowship in American Jewish History began in 1979 through the generosity of Julius Jacobs, of Jonesboro, Arkansas, who created the fund as a loving memorial to his wife. Marguerite Jacobs, born in 1904, was a lifelong resident of Jonesboro. In fact her family, the Rosenfields, were Arkansas pioneers who helped found the city of Jonesboro. (Julius Jacobs, born in 1903, was originally from Nashville, Tennessee.) In the early 1920s, Mrs. Jacobs helped save Jonesboro's Temple Israel from financial ruin by collecting dues, attending to business matters, and assisting in the financial growth of the Reform congregation. In later years, she served as both president and treasurer of the Temple sisterhood, and as superintendent of the religious school. Julius Jacobs was elected president of Temple Israel in 1948 and held that position for a decade. Additionally, he was president and secretary of the local chapter of B'nai B'rith and chairman of the Jewish Cemetery in Jonesboro. Marguerite Jacobs passed away on April 14, 1969. Julius Jacobs survived his wife by one year and died on October 26, 1970, at the age of 67. The Loewenstein-Wiener Fellowship in American Jewish Studies was created in 1976 from a generous bequest by Selma and Allen Berkman of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in memory of Mrs. Berkman's parents, Eli and Selma Loewenstein Wiener. The Loewenstein branch of Mrs. Berkman's family arrived in New York from Germany in 1868?eventually relocating to Waco, Texas following a fire that destroyed the family's textile company. The Wiener family began its American journey when Mrs. Berkman's paternal grandfather, Samson Wiener, emigrated from Germany to Buffalo, New York in 1854. Samson then migrated to Mississippi where he fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War. Samson's two sons, Sam and Eli (Mrs. Berkman's father), went on to found the town?and the Jewish community?of Keltys, Texas. Later, Eli Wiener moved his family to Shreveport, Louisiana and then on to Dallas, Texas. In Shreveport and Dallas, Eli served as president of the local synagogues?B'nai Zion Temple in Shreveport and Temple Emanu-El in Dallas. Selma Loewenstein Wiener was born in 1916. She married Allen Berkman (born in 1912), an attorney, in 1938. After moving to Pittsburgh, the Berkmans became involved in numerous Jewish and civic causes. Mrs. Berkman was a founder of the Jewish Archives of the Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania. She served on the local board of the National Council of Jewish Women and on the Temple Rodef Shalom Sisterhood board as both president and as a trustee. Mr. Berkman, the recipient of numerous honors for his outstanding community work, served as president of Rodef Shalom Congregation in Pittsburgh and is a Life Trustee of that congregation. He is a member of the National Board of Governors for the American Jewish Committee, and is on the Board of Directors of the National Conference of Christians and Jews (NCCJ). He is a member of the Board of Governors of the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion and is a member of the Board of Overseers for that school's Cincinnati campus. Selma Berkman died on December 5, 1995, at the age of 79. Her husband, their five children and 15 grandchildren survive her. The Bernard and Audre Rapoport Fellowships The Bernard and Audre Rapoport Fellowship was established through the generosity of Bernard and Audre Rapoport of Waco, Texas in 1979. A graduate of the University of Texas, Bernard is the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer for the American Income Life Insurance Company?a company which he joined in 1951 and has guided to unprecedented successes. Together with his wife Audre?also an alumna of the University of Texas?the Rapoports have devoted their lives to community service. Bernard has served as the Chairman of the Board of Regents of the University of Texas. He has been a member of the National Council on Crime and Delinquency, the Jerusalem Foundation, the United Cancer Foundation, the United Negro College Fund of Waco as well as numerous other organizations. Bernard has described his term as President and board of trustees member at Temple Rodef Sholom in Waco as one of his greatest honors. He has also served as a distinguished member of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, and as a member of the Board of Overseers of the Cincinnati School of the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion. Audre Rapoport has served as a dedicated member of the Temple Rodef Sholom Sisterhood for many years, working on committees for adult education, finance, and the religious school, among others. The couple's Rapoport Foundation is responsible for a multitude of community enhancement projects in the Waco area. Foundation funding enabled a faltering area elementary school to be transformed into the Rapoport Academy?which provides a top-rate education to the community's children. The Rapoport Foundation also provided funds to refurbish the Economics Building of the University of Texas. The Rabbi Fredric A. Doppelt Fellowship was established by Congregation Achduth Vesholom of Fort Wayne, Indiana as a way to honor Rabbi Doppelt, their esteemed religious leader of 30 years. Rabbi Fredric Doppelt was born in Sanok, Austria-Hungary, in 1906. He moved to the United States as a teenager and settled in the Chicago area. Rabbi Doppelt received his ordination from Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati in 1931. For 30 years, Rabbi Doppelt was the spiritual leader of Congregation Achduth Vesholom in Fort Wayne, Indiana. During his tenure, he distinguished himself as a gifted orator, teacher and scholar. Rabbi Doppelt's dedication to his family, his congregation and the community soon became legendary. His service on the Fort Wayne Interracial Committee, the USO (during the war years), the American Red Cross and as a board member of the Parkview Memorial and Lutheran Hospitals was deeply valued by the community he loved. Nationally, Rabbi Doppelt served on the executive boards of the National Red Cross Campaign, the American Jewish Historical Society and the Central Conference of American Rabbis. He was also a member of the governing board of the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion?through which he became involved with the American Jewish Archives and its founder, Dr. Jacob Rader Marcus. The Rabbi Levi A. Olan Fellowship began in 1986 as a gift from Temple Emanu-El of Dallas to honor a beloved teacher and leader of the Dallas Jewish community. Rabbi Levi A. Olan was born in 1903 in the Ukraine. Three years later his family was forced to flee the pogroms and immigrate to the U.S., eventually settling in Rochester, New York. In 1929, Olan received his rabbinic ordination from Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati. After serving as the spiritual leader of Congregation Emanuel in Worcester, Massachusetts for 20 years, Olan became the senior rabbi of Temple Emanu-El in Dallas. As he had done in Worcester, Rabbi Olan became deeply involved in the local community. His weekly radio program was renowned for the thought-provoking religious issues it raised?often tackling topics such as racial segregation and civil rights during the turbulent 1960s and 1970s. Olan, who became president of the Central Conference of American Rabbis in 1968, was also a highly respected scholar. He was a visiting lecturer at the Perkins School of Theology at Southern Methodist University as well as at the department of Religion at Texas Christian University. During his retirement, Rabbi Emeritus Olan was invited to lecture at the University of Texas, Emory University in Atlanta, the Institute of Religion in Houston, as well as at the Leo Baeck College in London, England. Rabbi Levi A. Olan died on October 17, 1984, at the age of 84. He was survived by Sarita, his wife of 53 years, and his three children: Elizabeth, Francis and David. The Rabbi Theodore S. Levy Tribute Fellowship began in 1981 as a tribute to Rabbi Levy from his congregants at the Temple Society of Concord, in Syracuse, New York. Rabbi Theodore Levy was born on April 16, 1926, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1945, his mentor, Rabbi Solomon B. Freehof of Pittsburgh's Rodef Shalom Temple, convinced a reluctant Levy to enter Hebrew Union College. At Hebrew Union College, Levy met Dr. Jacob Rader Marcus, who strongly encouraged Levy to complete his rabbinical studies. Following ordination, Rabbi Levy went on to serve four congregations with great distinction?including the Temple Society of Concord in Syracuse. His exemplary spiritual leadership was characterized by powerful commitments to education, family, community and social justice. He established social action committees in his congregations and initiated many civil rights education programs. He also was a participant in the 1963 civil rights march led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in Washington, D.C. Rabbi Levy and his wife Ina Rae spent the summers of 1952 and 1962 on archival expeditions with Dr. Jacob Rader Marcus. These expeditions enabled the American Jewish Archives to secure many important records which are now part of the AJA's permanent Burdman-Levy Archival Expedition Collection. Together, Rabbi Levy and Ina Rae raised three children, Seth, Cynthia, and Jonathan. The Starkoff Fellowship in American Jewish Studies began in 1987 with a generous bequest from Florence and Bernard Starkoff of Boca Raton, Florida. Bernard began his career in the 1940s as a congregational rabbi in Nashville, Tennessee. Eventually, Bernard left the rabbinate and the couple, along with their three children, returned \"home\" to Cleveland. They began work at Chemical Rubber Company (CRC), the chemical laboratory supply firm that Florence's father, Arthur Friedman, founded, owned and operated. In the 1950s, CRC published a booklet of chemical tables to give to its customers. Today, the hardback version of The Handbook of Chemistry and Physics is one of the oldest continuously published reference books still in print. The publishing division of CRC ultimately became an independent business entity. In the late 1970s, the Starkoffs relocated both companies to Florida. Throughout their lives, the Starkoffs have been generous supporters of many philanthropic organizations in South Florida. Mrs. Starkoff has served as a trustee of the Philharmonic Orchestra of Florida, the Palm Beach Council for the Arts, and the Mae Volen Senior Center. Mr. Starkoff has served on the boards of the South County United Way, the FAU foundation and the Kravis Performing Arts Center. The Joseph and Eva R. Dave Fellowship The Joseph and Eva R. Dave Fellowship was established in 2002 by Bernard and Jerome Dave in memory of their parents Joseph and Eva. In 1907, Joseph Dave emigrated from Poland to the United States with his mother and sister. Philip Dave, Joseph's father, had arrived in Am\nrica the year before and settled in Durham, North Carolina. In 1916 Joseph Dave graduated from Durham High School and entered Trinity College, now Duke University. After studying there for two years, Mr. Dave decided to enter the Co-op System in the Civil Engineering Department at the University of Cincinnati. As a freshman there, Joseph Dave had the opportunity to meet and befriend Dr. Jacob Rader Marcus, founder of the American Jewish Archives. After his graduation in 1923, Mr. Dave moved to Asheville, North Carolina, where he worked as a sales manager for the Southern Steel and Cement Company and in 1929, he founded the Dave Steel Company. Not only an astute businessman, Joseph Dave was also deeply invested in a number of civic organizations. He was instrumental in the construction of the Religious School for Asheville's Congregation Beth Ha Tephila where, in 1923, he worked to secure the services of Rabbi Sidney Unger to be the Temple's spiritual leader. Mr. Dave also became the first Jewish president of the Asheville Lion's Club in 1932, an organization in which he continued to be active throughout his life. During his residence in Cincinnati, Mr. Dave served on the Board of Trustees of Rockdale Temple, the Jewish Hospital, the Jewish Community Center, and Glen Manor. While living in Miami Beach, Florida, both Mr. and Mrs. Dave served on the board of the Greater Miami Jewish Home for the Aged. Joseph and Eva Dave are survived by their two loving sons, Bernard and Jerome, and five grandchildren. The Natalie Feld Memorial Fellowship in American Jewish Studies was created in 2001 through a bequest stipulated in Ms. Feld's will. Members of the Feld family have resided in the Cincinnati, Ohio area since the mid-nineteenth century. Natalie Feld was born in 1909 to Abraham and Katie Feld. Abraham Feld, whose father was one of the founding members of Cincinnati's Adath Israel Congregation, was a real estate investor and an entrepreneur who owned a furniture store in Cincinnati. Natalie, a gifted public speaker, chose education as a career path and became a high school mathematics teacher after earning two bachelor's degrees and a master's degree from the University of Cincinnati. She retired from teaching in the 1950s following the death of her mother. Later, Natalie herself entered the world of business and achieved a notable measure of success as both a business person and an investor. Her public speaking skills allowed her to advocate eloquently for the causes she believed in most. She was an amateur photographer, a musician and an avid reader of great literature. A lifelong member of the Friends of the Public Library, Ms. Feld bequeathed $2.5 million to the Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton Count?the largest bequest in the library's nearly 150-year history. She was also fascinated by history and genealogy, and became the official Feld family historian. She enjoyed communicating with her extended family by letter, writing long, descriptive missives about her trips throughout the world and the intriguing people she always seemed to meet along the way. She was also a supporter of the arts as evidenced by her tireless work on behalf of the Opera Guild and the Society for the Preservation of Music Hall in Cincinnati. Natalie Feld passed away in 1999 at the age of 90. The Rabbi Harold D. Hahn Memorial Fellowship was created in 2001 by his widow, Nancy Hahn Klein, and her husband Jerry E. Klein of Cincinnati. The perpetual fellowship will enable scholars to conduct independent research in subject areas relating to the history of North American Jewry. Candidates will be Ph.D. and post-doctoral students, senior scholars and independent researchers. Ordained at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in 1955, Rabbi Harold D. Hahn served in the Air Force Chaplaincy stationed in Rabat, Morocco. Upon returning to the United States, he served congregations in Broomall, Pennsylvania; Detroit, Michigan and Norfolk, Virginia before coming to Cincinnati's Rockdale Temple. Rabbi Hahn's love of the College-Institute was a strong incentive for him to come to Cincinnati when he was offered the historic pulpit in 1969. He embraced the opportunity to serve on the HUC-JIR Admissions Committee, Board of Alumni Overseers and Board of Governors. He served as chairperson of the Student Affairs Committee, reflective of his earlier tenure as student body president in the 1950s. When encouraged during the last days of his illness to express an unfulfilled wish, he asked that he be granted the honorary Doctor of Divinity Degree?due to be awarded by his beloved College-Institute in 1980?ahead of schedule. The degree was presented on Founders Day, 1978, in association with a tribute dinner sponsored by the congregation, and the gift of a family visit to Israel. Although in failing health, Harold was able to make the trip with Nancy and the children shortly before his death in May 1979. The establishment of the Rabbi Harold D. Hahn Fellowship will perpetuate the loving legacy of a man whose passion for Jewish thought and knowledge was boundless. The Rabbi Joachim Prinz Memorial Fellowship was established in 2001 by his son, Rabbi Jonathan Prinz, and the Deutsche Bank Americas Foundation. The fellowship will enable the recipient to conduct an extensive study of the Dr. Joachim Prinz collection, given to The Marcus Center by his family, in preparation for a doctoral dissertation or other scholarly publication. Rabbi Dr. Joachim Prinz (1902-1988), who served as President of the American Jewish Congress (AJC), was a gifted orator with a passion for racial and religious equality. Dr. Prinz was among the first to speak out against the rise of National Socialism in his native Germany and with the advent of the Hitler regime in 1933, he urged Jews to leave the country. Dr. Prinz was arrested several times during the rise of the Third Reich and was eventually expelled from Germany by the Gestapo in the summer of 1937. In the fall of 1939, at the recommendation of mentor and friend Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, Dr. Prinz became the rabbi of Temple B'nai Abraham in Newark, New Jersey. During his nearly 40-year tenure at Temple B'nai Abraham, Dr. Prinz, who also served as Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations, attracted a great following, primarily because of his outspoken views on both Judaism and on the events of the day. He saw the issue of civil rights as one of tremendous importance and related the struggle of African Americans to that of Jews seeking to repel majority oppression. The Rabbi Dr. Joachim Prinz collection at Cincinnati's Jacob Rader Marcus Center of the American Jewish Archives contains recordings, photos and other materials relating to the life and work of Dr. Prinz providing compelling insights into some of the 20th century's most defining moments. Established by the Corets Family in loving memory of their mother, grandmother and great-grandmother, the Bertha V. Corets Memorial Fellowship will enable students and scholars to spend one-month intensively researching the courageous actions of Mrs. Corets and the Non-Sectarian Anti-Nazi League to Champion Human Rights in their efforts to boycott American businesses?particularly retailers?that continued the importation and sale of goods from Nazi Germany before World War II. Bertha V. Corets (1897-1973) was a wife, mother, businesswoman, store-owner and advocate for social justice. Her many accomplishments include working to ensure the rights of women to vote, helping found a synagogue in her home community, forming Bronx Post 64, Ladies Auxiliary of the Jewish War Veterans of the U.S., and tirelessly advocating for the rights of Jews at home and in Nazi Europe. In early 1933, Bertha and her husband Mark (a veteran of World War I and soon to serve in the Navy in World War II) joined the Non-Sectarian Anti-Nazi League to Champion Human Rights. The League worked to identify goods made in Nazi Germany available for sale in American stores. Businesses that refused to stop selling these items, by League request, were then placed on a widely published boycott list. The list raised great awareness of the prevalence of Nazi-made goods for sale in the United States and had an impact on decreasing sales and imports of merchandise from Nazi Germany from the rise of Adolf Hitler until the U.S. entered World War II. Mrs. Corets immediately served as Secretary of the League under Chairman Samuel Untermyer, the celebrated Jewish patriot who rose to prominence as leader in the campaign to defend Jews in Germany. She also served as Boycott Chairman for the Jewish War Veterans. The purpose of the Corets Fellowship is to encourage research in this instrumental yet little-known effort and to highlight the courage and conviction of persons such as Bertha V. Corets, who faced personal danger in their work. Her extensive papers consist of her personal file of over 1,000 pages and publications recording the day-by-day activities of the boycott. Following the war, Mrs. Corets' social work continued by helping raise money for hospitals and institutions in Israel, including service in the Women's Division of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS) and the Israel Maritime League. Today, the papers of Bertha V. Corets reside at the American Jewish Archives. The Bertha V. Corets Memorial Fellowship will allow students of the anti-Nazi movement, women's studies and related subjects to examine the Corets papers together with other related holdings in the collections of the AJA to learn not only about this remarkable woman, but study this important era in American history. The Herbert R. Bloch, Jr. Fellowship was created in 2010 by his wife and son in loving memory of their husband and father?s life and work in the business world, the Jewish community and as a patron of the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion. Herbert R. Bloch, Jr. was born in Cincinnati on October 29, 1916, to Herbert and Jean (Kaufman) Bloch. After attending prep schools in Cincinnati and Watertown, Connecticut, Mr. Bloch graduated in 1939 from Yale University. Returning to Cincinnati, he immediately began working for Federated Department Stores (now Macy?s Inc.).  During World War II, Mr. Bloch interrupted his career at Federated to work for the Office of Price Administration in Washington, D.C., in 1941 before being drafted into the Quarter Master Corps and then serving in the U.S. Air Force as a First Lieutenant from 1942 to 1945.  Returning to business after the war, Mr. Bloch continued his rise through Federated, serving in several different positions at Shillito?s Department Store, eventually working his way up to Executive Vice President of the Federated chain. In 1973, he left Cincinnati to move to Los Angeles to take the same position at Bullock?s (now defunct), ultimately retiring from Federated in 1977 as Vice President.  Mr. Bloch was active in Jewish communal and philanthropic activities in Cincinnati and nationwide, fulfilling a mandate of service that was instilled in him as a child. His mother (herself a musician of note, both as performer and patron of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra) noted, ?We had a philosophy in our home. If you have something to offer, you are accepted for what you have to give. My children grew up with the feeling you don?t just take, but you also have to give.? Following in his father?s footsteps (who served as Chair of HUC-JIR?s Board of Governors from 1952 to 1957), Mr. Bloch served as Vice Chair, Secretary, and Chair of the Budget Committee of the HUC-JIR board from 1961 to 1986. He also served on numerous boards and commissions, including the Jewish Welfare Fund, Jewish Vocational Service, American Jewish Committee, the Foundation of Infantile Paralysis, the Jewish Federation, United Way, along with several youth related foundations. Bloch married Jane Meinrath on September 18, 1946. They had one son, Peter, born in 1948. After a long and debilitating battle with polio, Mrs. Bloch passed away in 1967. He remarried in 1969 to Jean Rosenthal. Herbert R. Bloch, Jr. died in Cincinnati on January 2, 2009, at the age of 92. He was survived by his wife, son, stepson, two stepdaughters, eight grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren. The Rabbi Ferdinand Isserman Memorial Fellowship was created by his beloved wife, Ruth Isserman, and the Isserman family. Ferdinand Isserman was born on March 4, 1898, in Antwerp, Belgium, and immigrated to the United States with his family in 1906. In 1914, he entered Hebrew Union College where, in conjunction with the University of Cincinnati, he studied for his bachelor's degree while training for the rabbinate. Upon ordination in June 1922, Isserman became Assistant Rabbi under Rev. Dr. Harry W. Ettelson at Rodeph Shalom Congregation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He remained in this position for three years, during which he studied at the University of Pennsylvania, receiving a Master of Arts degree in Comparative Religion in 1924. Isserman assumed the position of rabbi of the Toronto Hebrew Congregation (\"Holy Blossom\") in Canada in 1925. While in Toronto, he distinguished himself by arranging Canada's first pulpit exchange between a Christian minister and a Jewish rabbi. In 1929, he became rabbi of Temple Israel in St. Louis, Missouri, where he remained through 1963. Rabbi Isserman visited Nazi Germany three times in 1933, 1935 and 1937 and he spent the year of 1943 overseas with the American Red Cross during World War II. He participated in many civic as well as Jewish-oriented organizations. From 1932 to 1963, he conducted weekly Jewish programs on local radio stations and held an annual Institute on Judaism for the Christian Clergy at Temple Israel from 1937 to 1962. Rabbi Isserman also served as president of the University of Missouri Jewish Student Foundation from 1940 to 1947 and as first president of the combined Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion Alumni Association from 1950 to 1951. He chaired both the American Jewish Tercentenary Committee of St. Louis and the American Jewish Tercentenary Committee of Missouri in 1954, served as the American chairman of the World Union for Progressive Judaism from 1955 to 1956, and chaired the Thomas C. Hennings Jr. Memorial Committee in 1960. Rabbi Isserman was very active with the Central Conference of American Rabbis, serving as chairman on the Commission on Justice and Peace from 1942 through 1945. In 1942, Isserman helped organize and presided over the Commission's American Institute on Judaism and A Just and Enduring Peace; in 1945, he organized the Commission's Institute on Judaism and Race Relations; and in 1950 he helped organize the CCAR's Institute on Reform Jewish Theology Today.

Dissertations with no relevance to understanding human violence and aggression will not be supported. Priority will also be given to areas and methodologies not receiving adequate attention and support from other funding sources. These grants are made to Ph.D. candidates who are entering the dissertation stage of graduate school. Usually, this means that fieldwork or other research is complete and writing has begun. If analysis and writing are not far enough along for an applicant to be confident that he will complete the dissertation within the year, he should not apply, as the application will not be competitive with those that comply with this timetable. In some disciplines, particularly experimental fields, research and writing can reasonably be expected to be completed within the same year, and in those cases it is appropriate to apply. Recipients of the dissertation fellowship must submit a copy of the dissertation, approved and accepted by their institution, within six months after the end of the award year. Any papers, books, articles, or other publications based on the research should also be sent to the foundation. Applications are submitted online.

Federal financial aid comes in the form of student loans that you repay once you have completed your program or are no longer enrolled in college courses. Steps to receiving Federal financial aid Information that must be reviewed prior to consideration for financial aid: Private loans are available to students who do not qualify for other types of financial assistance or to defray educationally-related costs in excess of financial aid received from federal, state or other sources. Private loans are available to U.S. citizens, eligible non-citizens and also international students, at the discretion of the lender. Some lenders will approve loans only to credit-worthy U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens, while others will approve loans for international students provided they have a co-signer who is a credit-worthy U.S. citizen or an eligible non-citizen. Private loan programs are not affiliated with any federal financial assistance programs and are, therefore, generally more expensive. Approval of a private student loan application is based on creditworthiness, including debt-to-income ratio and credit history. Any questions please contact: Schiller International University is approved for veterans training programs. Veterans Affairs (VA) Educational Benefits are designed to provide eligible individuals with an opportunity for educational growth.

Wesleyan is now accepting applications for participation in the Wesleyan Freeman Asian Scholarship Program. The chosen applicants will join 2,900 other Wesleyan undergraduates from throughout the United States and nearly 50 countries for study with an outstanding teaching and research faculty in the sciences and mathematics, the arts, the humanities, and the social and behavioral sciences. This program is made possible by Wesleyan University and the Freeman Foundation, which aims to improve understanding and to strengthen ties between the United States and the countries and regions of the Pacific Rim. Wesleyan University is located in Middletown, Connecticut, halfway between New York and Boston in the historic and colorful New England region of the northeastern United States. It is a private, nonsectarian, liberal arts and sciences institution founded in 1831. A number of early Wesleyan graduates were influential educators and ministers in Asian countries, and the modern Wesleyan has formal ties to several prominent universities in Asia. The campus is home to a diverse population of 2,900 undergraduate students, equally divided between men and women, approximately 30 percent of whom are of African, Asian, or Hispanic descent, and nearly 260 students from foreign countries. Approximately 200 graduate students, a number of whom are from Asian countries, are pursuing advanced degrees, principally in the sciences, mathematics, and music. Wesleyan provides instruction in 47 major fields of study. Unlike some university systems abroad, in which students focus on one academic field, most American universities are based on a curricular tradition of liberal arts and sciences, in which breadth and depth of study are deemed equally important. At Wesleyan, the major programs of study involve one-third to one-half of a student?s course work, with the remaining time devoted to exploration of a variety of fields through which a student may broaden his or her background and understanding. More than 900 courses are offered, in which interdisciplinary pursuits are encouraged and an international perspective is fundamental. Wesleyan graduates go on in high numbers to the best graduate and professional schools in the United States and to successful careers in engineering, business, law, medicine, education, politics, international relations, social service, and the arts. The primary purpose of study at Wesleyan, however, is not to provide vocational training in a specific area. The objectives of a Wesleyan education include the development of self-educating men and women who have mastered a major field, have learned to think critically, are cognizant of the variety of human experience, and have acquired the habits of imaginative and disciplined minds. The liberal arts at Wesleyan are founded on an atmosphere of freedom, small college traditions, faculty resources, and student diversity. The University provides the facilities and opportunities of a research university while retaining the emphasis on teaching and the intimacy of a small college. The undergraduate student-to-faculty ratio is 9:1, enabling the faculty to provide direct and particular attention to undergraduate education. Wesleyan?s more than 330 teacher-scholars believe that scholarly research and active teaching are mutually reinforcing. The University?s curriculum is unusually flexible, and students work closely with a faculty advisor in planning all programs and majors. Many undergraduates cite the University?s relatively small size as a source of satisfaction with campus life. The community is small enough so that the individual may feel at home, yet large enough to provide a rich variety of activities and acquaintances. Life can be very full for undergraduates. Outside the classroom, they may select from more than 200 different student organizations that range in interest from theatrical productions to environmental activism, from the Wesleyan Argus newspaper and the debate club to Ultimate Frisbee, from the Asians for Community Empowerment to West African drumming or a chamber music group. The University?s state-of-the-art athletic center encourages students to participate in athletics, either in one of 27 varsity sports or at the intramural level. Parties and social gatherings are held at student residences, at the campus center, at fraternity houses, and at restaurants in Middletown. Bringing the wider world closer, prominent scholars, artists, musicians, actors, and dancers come to the campus regularly, and the weekly campus calendar features a continuous program of concerts, plays, films, and lectures. All Wesleyan students are guaranteed housing on campus for the full four years. They may choose among several options for housing and dining, and more than 90 percent of them live on or within one block of the campus. First-year students generally live in one of several residence hall complexes in either a double or single room. After the first year, Wesleyan offers a variety of housing options, including apartment complexes, furnished houses, and small rental houses. Membership in the dining plan is required for all four years, which allows students to eat in the many on-campus facilities as well as to buy food at the campus grocery store and cook their own meals. The Usdan University Center, opened in August 2007, provides a central location for dining and social activities. Certification of Finances Form Applicants for the academic year beginning in late August must have completed their secondary schooling* (high school) by then and must be citizens or permanent residents of one of these eleven countries or regions: People's Republic of China, SAR, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, R.O.C., Thailand, or Vietnam. Preference will be given to those currently living in one of these eleven countries or regions and to those who would otherwise be unable to study in the United States. Individuals with dual U.S. citizenship or who are permanent U.S. residents are not eligible. Students who must fulfill a military service requirement may apply in their final year of school but waiting until the year in which one can enroll is preferable. Admission to Wesleyan and the selection process for Wesleyan Freeman Asian Scholars is extremely competitive. We plan to award the scholarship to one student from each of the eleven countries or regions. Selection criteria include academic achievement; intellectual curiosity; a high level of discipline and commitment; strong personal qualities; extracurricular involvement, especially community service; and English language ability. It is our preference to enroll students currently studying and residing in their home countries, but students who are temporarily living elsewhere may apply. Please note that interviews of finalists take place in students? home countries or regions. Freeman Asian Scholars are expected to return to their home countries upon completion of their degrees. (We understand that some students may wish to continue their education with graduate studies in the United States, which would be at their own expense.) Successful applicants will be notified by April 1, except in Japan, where they will be notified by March 1. Alternates also will be chosen in the event that any of those initially selected decide not to accept the offer. Wesleyan will provide the necessary forms for obtaining an F-1 student visa to the United States. Websites for registering for standardized examinations: Please note that there is no longer a printed application packet available. Applicants must access the required forms electronically.

Dr. Atwater was born on June 17, 1907, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He attended the University of Iowa where he earned a B.A. degree in economics in 1929 and an M.S. in geology in 1930. He worked for state surveys in Iowa and New York, and for the U.S.G.S., finally returning to college in his home state where he was awarded a Ph.D. by the University of Wisconsin in 1936. Upon graduation, he went to work first for Amerada Petroleum Corp. and then Skelly Oil Co. In 1938, he joined the William Helis Oil Co. in New Orleans, filling the positions of chief geologist and head landman. In 1946, Dr. Atwater opened his own consulting practice, becoming the senior partner in the New Orleans consulting firm of Atwater, Cowan, Carter, Miller and Heffner where he remained active until his death. The firm still exists and is known as Atwater Consultants, Ltd. He received the Sidney Powers Memorial Medal in 1973. His citation was written by Grover E. Murray, and reads ?In recognition of extraordinary success as a petroleum geologist; for masterful and productive integration of geology, geophysics, and economics; for incisive analyses of salt diapirs, contemporary faulting, and the relationships of porosity to hydrocarbon productivity, and for cogent, lucid presentations of these analyses; and for mindful attention to public and individual problems of the petroleum industry.?

These fellowship awards are aimed at capacity building in developing countries, and the majority are given on a bilateral ? government-to-government ? basis. ?Candidates cannot apply for funding personally; their employer must apply. The donors have indicated that they will support only candidates who are employed by their national governments, and that priority will be given to the least developed countries. It is expected that applicants will be aged under 40. Specific donors have additional requirements and preferences. For example, they may support women, or candidates from a specific region or range of countries. Some fellowships cover the cost of a full fellowship, and may or may not cover the additional cost of the English & Study Skills Program. Others provide only the University Fee. The candidates? employers are expected to complete the application for funding in great detail with a full account of the candidate and the anticipated effect of a WMU education. After graduation, successful applicants are expected to return to their sending organization and to be committed to capacity building for some years. The employer is expected to pay the salary of their staff member throughout their studies at WMU, to provide a plane ticket to Sweden, and to utilize the student effectively after graduation. Employers should not put an applicant forward for funding unless they have given careful consideration to his/her suitability to join the WMU program and have clear plans for how the graduate will be utlilized in the future.

On an annually-alternating basis, the call for nominations addresses areas within the natural and engineering sciences, the life sciences, and the social sciences and humanities. 113 years after the foundation of quantum theory by Max Planck, researchers succeed in controlling materials with ever higher precision to realize exotic quantum states. Thus nano structured materials and devices arise, that by exploiting the most bizarre features of quantum mechanics ? take discretisation, superposition, entanglement and many body systems as examples - are designed for special purposes. Such phenomena form the focus of the relatively young experimental field of Quantum Nano Science that has emerged at the interfaces of nano science, quantum optics, photonics, materials technology and quantum information.

The recent events and the social movements across North Africa and the Middle East (MENA) region have highlighted the emergence of a new generation of leaders that yearn for social change.\n \n They long for meaningful work but don't know how to focus their energy and effectively impact their societies in the time of crisis. They shall see the creative chaos of this time as a great gift and opportunity to rethink, reconnect, and reinvent.

The purpose of the fellowship is to engage young open-minded leaders and support their growth as change-makers to effectively contribute to the region?s democratic transition. The retreat will include interactive activities, meditation sessions, lectures and discussions providing the participants with new skills for non-violent resistance. They will wield the power of their position responsibly, with care for others in their heart, as a result of embodying the qualities of meditation.

Some of this money could be YOURS. The trick is knowing not only where to look for scholarships, but also how to apply for them. Even though they may not fully cover your study abroad costs, the decrease in your student expenses will increase your budget for personal expenses (read: fun!) The following tips and resources will serve as a guide for finding study abroad scholarships and grants that will alleviate the expense of studying abroad. Scholarships and Grants for Study Abroad In the United States alone, there are thousands of scholarships available to students seeking international education, from national awards funded by the government to smaller-scale awards attached to a particular program or university. Make sure you explore all financial aid options available to whatever specific study abroad program you choose. Another useful tip is to check with the government of the country where you intend to study for any scholarships they might offer. Contact an embassy, consular office or the country's department of education. Many countries offer financial support to international students to make study in their country a more attractive and feasible option. One of best, and increasingly underestimated, places to focus your search for financial aid is right on your home campus. Try visiting the financial aid office, study abroad office, and the foreign language departments to inquire about available funding. Search online or ask your study abroad advisor.  There are many different types of scholarships available. Some are based on need, academic merit, or might be limited to foreign language majors or minors. For this reason alone, you may want to consider declaring a primary or secondary major in a language. This might make you eligible for more scholarships, both on and off campus, or a more attractive candidate to receive a scholarship. Also, don't overlook other departments that might be offering assistance for foreign study. Scan your college catalogue or visit other departments that interest you for information about department-specific programs and scholarships. Many scholarships and programs of foreign study are available to students in business, engineering, anthropology, art history, and music. Make known your ambitions to many of your professors, as they may know of opportunities for funded research projects you can participate in while studying abroad. Because campus-based scholarships are much less competitive than those on a national level, the probability that you will receive one is much higher. After taking inventory of all the resources available on campus to financially support your study abroad program, start tapping into your connections within your local community (this could be both the community your university is located in, and your home town!) You might inquire on campus or search online for names of local or regional heritage groups or language associations: Sons of Italy chapters, German clubs, Hispanic heritage groups, Chinese-American associations, etc. These local organizations tend to like supporting students in their home community. After gathering a list of organizations, call or visit each group that is relevant to your studies and inquire about scholarship opportunities. Making the effort to visit the organizations and create a small relationship with them is a great way to emphasize your underlying interest in receiving a scholarship. Like the campus-based scholarships, a great advantage to these types of scholarships is that they are awarded on a regional basis. Application pools are much smaller than for national scholarships and your chances of receiving aid is thereby much greater. US Department of Education FAFSA website. When you fill out the FAFSA, you are not only being considered for federal funding, but also state financial aid programs. The federal government forwards your information on to your state for evaluation. Because state deadlines differ, be sure you get your FAFSA in early to be eligible for state aid awards. The internet is an excellent resource for locating a large number of study abroad scholarships. Many of these scholarships will allow you to apply directly online; potentially, you can apply for dozens of scholarships in a few short hours. However, their one downfall is that these scholarships are also equally available to everyone else online. A larger application pool will reduce your chances to be awarded aid, but remember, you have to be in it to win it! I recommend being specific in your search queries for study abroad scholarships, such as including your intended destination or university, or the language you wish to study. The broader you are, the more convoluted your search results will be, which may result in google-aches, scholarship-exhaustion, or being plain overwhelmed.

It's a pretty cool gig. I started this way back when I was teaching English in Taiwan for a couple years, and the site has evolved into a whole directory of opportunities to teach, study, volunteer, and intern abroad. When I'm not fixing problems and taking names, you'll usually find me at the nearest beach, or playing soccer. I'm a passionate Barcelona FC fan and Spain supporter.

You must be eligible as of the date the application is received at NSERC. If your eligibility for the award could run out while the IPS Agreement is in preparation, the university should forward the incomplete application to NSERC with an explanatory cover letter.   What types of scholarships are available?  Industrial postgraduate scholarships are available in two categories: IPS 1 and IPS 2.  This scholarship support is for a minimum of 12 months (in exceptional circumstances only) up to a maximum of 24 months and must be held during the first three years of graduate study.  At the time NSERC receives the nomination, you:  IPS 1 support will not extend beyond the 28th month of your master's program. If you are a successful applicant and if you have completed more than four months full-time equivalent in a master's program at the time you take up your award, the normal 24-month duration of the award will be decreased by the number of months in excess of the four that have been completed at that time.

For the application to be considered, this letter must cover each  of the following topics: The person signing this letter should be the student?s direct industrial  research supervisor. If an organization is hosting more than one IPS award, the  organization must provide a separate, individualized letter for each student.  If the expected student experience described in the letter does not  meet the expectations for the IPS Program, the application may be rejected. If you are a part-time student, the organization?s contribution must be at least $3,000 per year, and you will be eligible for up to 72 months of support at one-half the normal stipend level ($7,500 per year). You must spend at least 25 full-time equivalent days at the organization per year.   Which organizations are eligible to participate?

Our top-tier academic programs, led by innovative faculty, enable students to develop their knowledge and apply it to real-world settings. With opportunities to study abroad, participate in faculty-led research, and intern at prominent organizations, our students receive the preparation and experience to pursue successful, rewarding careers. What separates MU from other institutions is the attention we give to each student. No large lecture halls. No classes taught by graduate students. Classes are small, and professors are proud to know their students by name. With such close interaction at MU, students have more opportunities to learn and succeed. They're conducting hands-on research with faculty. They're getting one-on-one counseling and support. They're networking. This is the Monmouth experience, where every student matters. Located in a safe, suburban area, MU is approximately one hour from both New York City and Philadelphia, making it easier for students to apply classroom learning to real-world experience. Our 156-acre campus, one of the most beautiful in New Jersey, is down the road from the beaches of the Atlantic Ocean, providing a natural classroom for students, as well as a fun, enriching college experience.

As a major step toward that objective, in 2005 RWU launched an online two-year associate?s degree program certified by the State of Wisconsin. That successful program is now on hold while support and curricula are developed for a full four-year degree program in Americanist studies with special emphasis on the classics. RWU has and continues to support other educational programs, seminars, and research. Robert Welch was born on December 1, 1899, in rural Chowan County, North Carolina. An uncommonly gifted youth, Robert Welch learned to  read at age two with the help of his mother, who was a school teacher.  By age four he knew his multiplication tables, and by age six was  proficient in algebra. At age seven, young Robert began learning Latin  and also read all nine volumes of Ridpath?s History of the World, a  sweeping account of world history as admired for its depth and scope in  the nineteenth century as Will and Ariel Durrant?s multi-volume world  history is in our time. Robert was schooled at home by his mother until age ten, when his parents decided to enroll him in high school. Robert so astounded the  local high school principal with his grasp of mathematics, Latin,  English, and history that he was enrolled as a high school junior, even  though he was still a ten-year old boy. At age twelve, Robert Welch became the youngest person ever to  enroll at the University of North Carolina. While at the university,  Robert Welch developed a passion for languages, and mastered both  French and German sufficiently well to read literary classics in the  original. He also became an accomplished chess player and displayed an  exceptional aptitude for mathematics. Robert developed a lifelong  passion for scholarship that informed everything he did. He became a  successful businessman and world traveler, as well as a husband and  father. He amassed a personal library consisting of more than five  thousand volumes, most of which he had read. Robert Welch dreamed of  setting up a liberal arts college, where young Americans could be  educated in the same classical traditions as the Founding Fathers.  Robert Welch passed away on January 6, 1985. The study of the Classics and Classical Civilizations are the cornerstones of Robert Welch University, and they were also the core  ideals, value, morals and principles of the founding era. Robert Welch  defined these as, ??a positive, forward-looking philosophy; a design  and example of social organization which boldly and confidently offers  leadership along the one hard but sure road to a better world.?", "id": 9991092}, {"text": "Index of Articles NEBHE/Boston magazine Annual Guide Find a Beijing Institution Find a Beijing Institution The New England?China Scholarship Program is an outstanding and timely opportunity for New England college and university students. unique variety of institutions The New England?China Scholarship Program resulted from a relationship between the NEBHE Board and the Beijing Municipal Education Commission, which began by a visit to China by a NEBHE Board delegation in 2006.

Since 1986, MICD has helped transform communities through design by preparing mayors to be the chief urban designers of their cities. More than 850 mayors nationwide have participated in the program. To advance public interest and education in design and architecture, the American Architectural Foundation and the Chicago Architecture Foundation established the Architecture + Design Education Network.

Accent on Architecture Gala Accent on Architecture Gala For the past twenty-three years, national leaders in design, government, and education have gathered in Washington, DC, for this black-tie event hosted by the American Architectural Foundation. With a program rich in ideas, the Gala has become the nation?s premier celebration of leadership in architecture and urban design. The 24th-annual Gala took place on March 22, 2013, at the historic Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium. Accent on Architecture Grants Accent on Architecture Grants AAF?s Accent on Architecture grants assist local, non-profit organizations in producing innovative design-education programs for children.

They enhance the visibility and public understanding of architecture and strengthen relationships between communities and local design groups. Presented by the American Architectural Foundation, the Keystone Award is an annual national award that honors an individual or organization from outside the field of architecture for exemplary leadership that increases the value of architecture and design in our culture.

The inaugural Riley Award went to former Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley in 2011. Since 1990, the Richard Morris Hunt Fellowship, co-sponsored by the American Architectural Foundation and the French Heritage Society, has offered mid-career American and French design professionals an intensive six-month exchange experience that showcases the latest scholarship and practice around historic preservation and architectural heritage.

LankaCorps Fellowships: July 1 - December 31, 2014. Deadline for applications (including letters of reference) was February 14, 2014. LankaCorps is an exciting new opportunity for North Americans of Sri Lankan background to \"explore their roots while giving back\" to the country of their heritage. The Asia Foundation is pleased to announce that a new group of young leaders will once again be selected for the 2014 fellowship year to live and work for six months in Sri Lanka. Background and Purpose The recent settlement agreement between the Sri Lankan government and the LTTE follows decades of conflict. Attention has now turned to rebuilding a cohesive state that restores critical institutions. The Asia Foundation Representative Office, present in Sri Lanka since 1954, is a vital partner in the ongoing rehabilitation of this dynamic and multi-ethnic nation. As part of this effort, the Foundation has created LankaCorps: (1) to help members of the expatriate Sri Lankan community engage with post-conflict Sri Lanka; and (2) to enhance understanding of contemporary Sri Lanka within the expatriate community and the broader public. The program's intent is to foster identification with Sri Lanka among the young members of the expatriate community who have limited in-depth experience with the country.

We work with students and parents through the process of applying for scholarships and other financial aid. The awarding of financial aid, whether merit or need-based, cannot occur until after a student has completed the admission application, the audition/interview process and has been accepted. We?believe that students should choose a school because it offers the right education, the right teachers and the right environment. While there is no question that financial considerations are important, it is our experience that choosing a school based solely on the amount of money offered is a one-dimensional approach that deprives students of some of the very experiences they are seeking in a college education. All admissions decisions are made independently of financial aid decisions; applicants are not judged by their financial standing. To retain an Eastman School merit scholarship, a student must maintain a cumulative grade point average (CGPA) of 3.0 or better; must be a full-time student during each semester covered by the award; and must continue to make satisfactory progress toward completion of his or her degree, as determined by performance in an annual jury and by Eastman?s Academic Progress Review each semester. An undergraduate?s merit scholarship will have a monetary reduction each semester if the CGPA falls below 3.0 or these expectations are not met. Federal and State funds?

CSS PROFILE for International Students FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) As a student?s need often varies from year to year, Eastman need-based eligibility will be reviewed and awards adjusted each year accordingly. A student who continues to meet the need criteria each year may receive?the Eastman grant?for up to eight semesters of full-time undergraduate enrollment provided that they remain in good academic standing and maintain satisfactory progress towards their degree.? If a student is released from his/her housing contract, Financial Aid reserves the right to review the student?s eligibility for institutional need-based aid. Filing the FAFSA The processed FAFSA (SAR) provides a financial need-analysis of data submitted by both the student and parent(s). The student and parent(s)?are responsible for checking the accuracy of the information submitted. Eligibility for all need-based funds is determined through Eastman?s review and verification of this data. A link (ESM FAOnline) to the Financial Aid Package is emailed to undergraduates with the letter of acceptance from the Admissions Office.

In cases where an accepted student has no processed FAFSA or CSS PROFILE for International Students at Eastman, a student will receive a Financial Aid Package with the acceptance letter identifying the merit scholarship and the ?missing? financial aid documents.

For example, if a student is accepting the offer from Eastman, then?the completed enrollment form and deposit will be returned to the Eastman Admissions Office.??The?enrollment form for the College must also be completed?and returned to the College?s Admissions Office indicating that Eastman will be the billing campus. Many Dual Degree students prefer to live on the Eastman campus to be near to practice facilities, but students have the option to live on either campus. The meal plan can be used on both campuses. Students will receive a housing and meal plan contract from each campus. Only the housing and meal plan contract for the campus on which the student chooses to live needs to be completed. If a Dual Degree student does not wish to live on the billing campus, the student will need to contact the Residence Life Office for the campus where he/she wishes to live to confirm that they will have space available.

NASM release form The Eastman School of Music provides financial support to its graduate students primarily through the Graduate Award Program, a merit-based system of financial aid. Through its graduate awards, Eastman is able to provide in-depth professional training for graduate students and receive valuable services in return. Graduate applicants, who are not only highly recommended in their major, but who also are highly recommended for a graduate award, receive the most merit-based financial support from Eastman. The graduate awards are processed through the Graduate Studies Office. A graduate award normally consists of a stipend (salary for the work done) and a tuition scholarship (a partial remission of tuition). A small number of awards are tuition scholarship only. Admission to a graduate program does not guarantee a graduate award. Applying for a Graduate Award Some view the process of applying for a graduate award as similar to a job interview. Applicants requesting graduate awards that are performance-based (for example, a stipend or fellowship awarded in return for ensemble participation) are considered on the basis of their degree program audition. Other graduate awards require preparation of specific materials, and interviews or auditions with faculty members who supervise those awards. (See the graduate award application for specifics.) Faculty supervisors are reluctant to recommend candidates for positions of responsibility unless they have had an opportunity to meet and evaluate those candidates. Therefore, graduate applicants who cannot audition in Rochester have significantly reduced chances of receiving a graduate award. Graduate awards are assigned for the school year; because of this, there typically are few or no awards available for graduate applicants who wish to begin study in January. All graduate applicants must complete the Application for Graduate Award; students who do not wish to be considered for an award must indicate so on the graduate award application. The form lists more than 40 work specialties. Applicants should indicate up to four areas of specialty in which they are most qualified, and provide an outline of experience in each area together with the name, address, position, and telephone number of the person who is most qualified to recommend the applicant for work in each position. (Please note that some awards require the completion of an additional form, or preparation of specific materials, and some graduate awards are restricted to specific majors.) All graduate award interviews and auditions are scheduled on the same day as the applicant?s audition/interview for a degree program. After all auditions and interviews are completed, faculty supervisors make their recommendations for graduate award recipients to the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies. The Associate Dean determines the final disposition of graduate awards, including fellowships and stipends, based on faculty input, the strength of the candidate?s application, and the needs of the School.

Research programs include instrumentation, observation, and theory in atomic and molecular physics, geophysics, the solar system, stars, galaxies, and cosmology. Techniques used range from computer simulations through observations across the bandwidths, to instrument development and laboratory experiments. Graduate students at Harvard benefit from the CfA's diverse research environment, with access to extensive facilities to pursue their work in a supportive and stimulating setting. Nearly 300 scientists from CfA's research divisions are available as advisors. Since 1985, students from other institutions throughout the world--in addition to those associated with the Harvard University Departments of Astronomy and Physics--have done their thesis research at CfA, through the SAO Predoctoral Fellowship Program. Undergraduate and High School Programs Undergraduate and High School Programs Harvard's Department of Astronomy offers undergraduates choice among various levels of concentration in astronomy or astronomy and physics. In addition, numerous opportunities to participate in research projects with CfA scientists are available-- both for Harvard students and those from other institutions--as paid work, part of a degree program, or summer internships.

Students are eligible for full financial support (stipend, full tuition remission and health   insurance) only if they receive at least a single 0.5 FTE or two 0.25 FTE assistantship positions. Assistantships awarded to students for performing duties that are outside of their program   requirements are compensated per hour of work. GTA appointments of 0.5 FTE (20 hours per week)   normally require teaching of no more than 2 courses or laboratories. All assistantship   appointments of 0.25 FTE (10 hours per week) must be for duties that require, on average, 10 hours of work per week. The employment philosophy of the College of Graduate Studies is that full-time graduate assistants with a full-time course load should not pursue outside employment. Programs may discourage graduate assistants from taking outside employment, but cannot prevent them from doing so. Please indicate to assistants who choose to take outside employment that they will be held to the same standards in terms of their work and academic progress as others who do not. Graduate assistants are not allowed to be employed simultaneously in any other job code at UCF (undergraduate OPSSTU, adjunct faculty, OPSGRD, or A&P, Faculty, Staff, etc.). A UCF graduate assistant may be hired as: Please make assistantship assignments that correspond to the duties to be performed, as   indicated in the table below. The three categories of graduate teaching assistants (GTAs) may be   assigned as instructors of record for undergraduate courses, as assistants to the faculty in   their teaching responsibilities or in other roles directly related to credit-earning formal   course instruction, or as tutors for students on specific course-related material or general   skills. Faculty teaching assistant responsibilities may include assisting in laboratory courses, grading, preparing course materials, or performing clerical tasks associated with course instruction. GTAs must complete all training requirements for their position code before they begin their assignments. Under no circumstances are students in GRA or GA position codes allowed   to engage in instructional assignments. Nondegree-seeking students may be employed at the university, but must be classified as Student Assistants (not Graduate Assistants). A graduate student enrolled at the university and employed who does not meet the criteria for being a graduate assistant should be hired in the OPSGRD (temporary) job code. As opposed to the OPS job code, the OPSGRD classification specifically benefits graduate students by exempting them from FICA taxes. The University of Central Florida sets a stipend level (shown in the following table) that is the minimum allowable for students to be hired as graduate assistants and to receive tuition   remission. These minimum stipend amounts are NOT nationally competitive. To attract high-quality   students to your program, stipends for graduate assistants must be at a rate that is   commensurate with your competitor institutions. The College of Graduate Studies can provide you   with comparison national averages for your discipline. UCF requires graduate departments to follow university-approved standards and procedures in hiring their graduate assistants.  Hiring of graduate assistants must be processed through the College of Graduate Studies (Millican Hall 230) and the Office of Human Resources. The Graduate College requires that an Assistantship Agreement and ePAF be submitted with any accompanying information. It is important to have all of the information assembled before entry and to have provided this to your staff.  *Includes semester breaks in December/January, April/May, and August, as well as spring break. Employment of International Students According to INS regulations, graduate students who are on an F-1 or J-1 visa may   accept employment on campus without prior INS approval as long as students are enrolled   full-time and employment does not interfere with their studies. Off-campus employment, however,   must be at locations affiliated with the university either through contractually funded projects or associated with the university curricula. Curricular Practical Training is authorized by the International Services Center only to students who qualify for Curricular Practical Training for off-campus employment. On-campus employment is limited to no more than 20 hours per week while school is in session. Such employment may be full-time during vacation periods for students who are eligible and   intend to register for the subsequent academic term. On-campus employment is not permitted after completion of the program of study, unless the student is issued a Form I-20A-B to begin a new program and intends to enroll for the next regular academic year, term, or session. Students who received a bachelor's degree at one school and will start a master's degree at UCF are eligible to work   during the summer at either the original school or UCF as long as a Form I-20A-B was issued for   the new master's program. International students on an F-1 visa are eligible for one year of optional practical training after completion of their program. This is a wonderful opportunity for international   students to get practical experience while at the same time learning about the employment   culture in the U.S. Please encourage your international students to consider this opportunity upon graduation. Those who are on dependent visas, either F-2 or J-2 cannot be employed by the university in   these visa statuses, and must change their visa status to F-1 or J-1 before they can be assigned duties as an OPS employee or graduate assistant. Also, those in H-1B visa categories cannot be enrolled full-time in graduate coursework or be employed as a graduate assistant without violating their visa status, since the H-1B visa is sponsored by an employing agency and requires them to work. Resignation and Early Termination of an Assistantship Except in cases of gross misconduct that require immediate termination, a supervisor must   follow the procedure outlined   below in order to end an appointment early. Assessment of Graduate Assistants Assessment plays an important role in assisting graduate students in their professional   development. Faculty should evaluate their graduate assistants each semester and provide feedback and guidance for improvement.  The College of Graduate Studies recommends that this assessment be documented in the faculty supervisor???s records. The assessment should be discussed with the student, and the student should be given an opportunity to respond to the assessment in writing.  The Graduate Council Program Review Committee has adopted a template that may be used by programs in providing annual progress assessments of their doctoral students. The program may use any format for annual progress assessments that they choose, but annual progress assessments are required for all doctoral students.", "id": 999656}, {"text": "Remington College Merit- and Need-Based Scholarships Scholarships Available at Remington College: Since its founding, Remington College has been committed to the success of its students and providing educational opportunities in the communities it serves.

Each Rolex Scholarship provides a hands-on introduction to underwater and other aquatic-related endeavors for a young person considering a career in an underwater-related discipline. One scholar is selected from each of the three regions and each scholar spends approximately one year working side by side with current leaders in underwater fields. Each scholar travels primarily within his or her region, but may have opportunities throughout the underwater world. The range of experiences may include active participation in field studies, underwater research, scientific expeditions, laboratory assignments, equipment testing and design, photographic instruction, and other specialized assignments. Scholars pursue activities in their chosen disciplines during the one-year period between Our World Underwater Scholarship Society??annual spring meetings. Experiences may last from a few days to over a month. At the conclusion of each experience, the scholar moves on to another, so the scholarship year involves extensive travel. The scholar is literally on the road from spring-to-spring with very little time at a home base. Scholars spend most of the year with the society's friends, hosts, and coordinators around the world. The experiences vary from year to year depending upon the scholar's interests and the availability of expeditions and hosts' opportunities. These experiences make up the real heart of the scholarship. The opportunity to join a host's daily activities exposes the scholar to the realities of the host's special pursuits. Each of the three Rolex Scholarships has a coordinator who organizes itineraries for his or her scholar - emphasizing breadth of experience, but tailoring the itenerary to the individual scholar?s background and interests. These itineraries include time with specialists in such areas as biology, hyperbarics, anthropology, and archaeology. Scholar hosts include scientists, engineers, filmmakers, and marine mammal researchers. Visits to dive store operations, classes in underwater photography, and working with conservation organizations are also typical experiences. These experiences provide the scholars with a broad overview of careers in the underwater world. Scholars may spend varying lengths of time investigating: The global underwater community sees the selected North American, European, and Australasian scholars as individuals with the potential to make significant contributions to the underwater world even though they may not have yet chosen a specific career path. During the course of the year, exposure to a wide array of types of work and the chance to actually jump in and experience specific jobs provides scholars with invaluable career-deciding opportunities. The scholarship emphasizes hands-on experience in activities that will contribute to a well-rounded education and a broad network of contacts. The Our World-Underwater convention established the first scholarship in 1974 and until its sale in 1998 was the primary funding source to the Society. Today, the Society offers two Rolex Scholarships as well as a variety of internships and other educational opportunities. The Rolex Scholarships are entirely funded by donations from Rolex Watch USA and Rolex-Geneva. The Society and its other educational programs are additionally funded by generous corporate sponsors and individuals including E.P.I.C, Mercury Marine, and many others. The original amount of the scholarship was $5,000, and it has been raised in increments over the years. This amount is reviewed at the Board of Directors's annual meeting. The maximum cash amount for the North American Rolex Scholarship is $25,000, for the European Rolex Scholarship the amount is ?16,000 and for the Australasian Scholarship Aus $30,000 Our World-Underwater Scholarship Society? funds are used for transportation and living expenses. The North American and European Rolex Scholars must submit a complete accounting for all expenditures.

Art Meyerhoff was born in Northampton, Massachusetts, son of Howard A. Meyerhoff, later a well-known professor of geology. Art grew up in Massachusetts and Puerto Rico. At 16 he went to Yale University and in short order he received his B.A. degree there and his M.S. degree and Ph.D. at Stanford University. In 1952 he was ready to tackle the geological world and he did. He started his career with the Standard Oil Company of California (1952-1965). He did exploration work and mapping in various South and Central American countries. This was followed by work in various capacities, including geophysics, in the United States Gulf Coast region. From 1965 to 1974 he was Publications Manager of AAPG, based in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Thereafter, he was primarily a geological consultant, doing work for government agencies of many countries, for most major oil companies (including Exxon and Shell), and many smaller companies. His work carried him to the four corners of the globe. During this time he also taught at Oklahoma State University and the University of Calgary in Canada. Also, he was a Visiting Scholar at Cambridge University. He lectured frequently in all parts of the world, sometimes in an honorary capacity. He loved teaching and research. His opposition to the plate tectonics concept was indefatigable and made him famous. He saw the flaws and contradictions of plate tectonics. There is something exhilarating about a man going against the main stream of scientific thought and not yielding ? providing his objections have substance. Art?s do. At first he was involved in often passionate debate. Later, his writings were often left unanswered ? as though science is served by silence. By 1988 Art Meyerhoff, with the help of coworkers, had developed an alternate hypothesis called ?surge Tectonics.? They suggest that all major features of the earth, including those beneath the sea, are underlain by more or less fluid igneous rocks, which tend to flow parallel to these features. These channels are inter-connected, forming a worldwide hydraulic network. This hypothesis explains a remarkable number of observed earth phenomena. These ideas were published in 1992 by Texas Tech University Press in the book, New Concepts in Global Tectonics, edited by S. Chatterjee and N. Hotton III. In 1951 he married Kathryn (Kay) Laskaris. It was a good marriage that resulted in three children, James, Richard, and Donna, all of whom did well. Kay helped Art in many ways, including drafting. Art was devoted to his family, and they to him. ?This is nothing to be sad about,? Art Meyerhoff wrote in late 1994, announcing his having only a few more weeks to live. Thus, in facing death as well as living his life, he displayed courage, the one virtue, as Churchill mentioned, that makes all other virtues possible. He died of lung cancer on September 18, 1994. Art Meyerhoff was one of perhaps a dozen eminent earth scientists of this century. Whether he was one of those rare great men who turned their science into a new direction remains to be seen. His ideas will long be debated. He was a highly principled person. He was a credit to his science, his family, and his friends.  (Excerpts of this biography are from the memorial by Ted Ranneft published in the AAPG Bulletin.)  The Arthur A. Meyerhoff Memorial Grant is awarded annually to two deserving graduate students through the AAPG Foundation Grants-in-Aid program. It is endowed with generous contributions from friends, with special thanks to Dr. Grover E. Murray for his efforts in contacting the many individuals who contributed toward the grant.

United States American students may apply for certain forms of grants and federal aid to assist with costs of college. For students who qualify, more information about specific forms of financial aid for qualified American students can be found on this page. The U.S. Department of Education?s federal financial aid programs are the largest source of student aid in America, providing nearly 70% of all student financial aid. Help is available to make education beyond high school financially possible. U.S. Department of Education Student Aid website National Science and Math Access to Retain Talent (SMART) Grant Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant Once you have determined if you qualify for any of the above listed federal grants, you may begin applying for Federal financial aid.? Federal financial aid comes in the form of student loans that you repay once you have completed your program or are no longer enrolled in college courses. Steps to receiving Federal financial aid Information that must be reviewed prior to consideration for financial aid: Private loans are available to students who do not qualify for other types of financial assistance or to defray educationally-related costs in excess of financial aid received from federal, state or other sources. Private loans are available to U.S. citizens, eligible non-citizens and also international students, at the discretion of the lender. Some lenders will approve loans only to credit-worthy U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens, while others will approve loans for international students provided they have a co-signer who is a credit-worthy U.S. citizen or an eligible non-citizen. Private loan programs are not affiliated with any federal financial assistance programs and are, therefore, generally more expensive. Approval of a private student loan application is based on creditworthiness, including debt-to-income ratio and credit history. Any questions please contact: Schiller International University is approved for veterans training programs. Veterans Affairs (VA) Educational Benefits are designed to provide eligible individuals with an opportunity for educational growth. It is certainly one of the most valuable benefits afforded to veterans and qualifying dependents and should be wisely utilized. To apply for Veteran Education benefits, please follow the steps below: New students who have never used their education benefits, fill out the VA form 22-1990 Transfer students who have used their benefits, fill out the VA Change of Place of Training form 22-5495 2. Send a copy of the application and a photocopy of your DD 214 page 4, to the Financial Aid/Veterans Services Office: 3. Fill out Schiller International University?s VA Benefits Request form and send to the Financial Aid/Veterans Services Office. See above contact information. 4. The Financial Aid/Veterans Services Office will electronically certify your enrollment online with the Government VA Department (processing time is currently running about 60 days). 5. It is your responsibility to notify the Financial Aid/Veterans Services Office if you drop a class, fail or withdraw from all classes or graduate. All changes made after the initial applications or certifications are forwarded to the Atlanta Regional Office and should be brought to the attention of the Veterans Affairs Office so the change can be reported. The most common changes include: Failure to report changes constitutes fraud and is the primary cause of delays in the delivery of your educational checks and occurrences of overpayment. Changes may be reported to the Veterans Affairs Office in person or by telephone. Periodic audits are conducted and changes in schedule are caught, but it is ultimately the students? responsibility to report these changes before incurring an overpayment or possibly an underpayment.

All students must remain full time in order to receive their scholarship. Scholarships are awarded for a maximum of four years for undergraduate, two years for graduate and one year for postgraduate study. Awards for an additional year are not guaranteed. If a student feels the need for an additional semester or year to complete their degree, the student may petition the scholarship committee. Petition forms are available in the Financial Aid Office, or online, must be signed by both the student and the studio teacher and presented to the scholarship committee one semester prior to the anticipated graduation date. \tUndergraduate students must maintain a cumulative 2.5 grade point average to be eligible for renewal of their scholarships, while graduate students must maintain a cumulative 3.0 grade point average. If a student's grade point average falls below the required minimum, he or she will be placed on academic probation for one semester. If the student's grade point average is not raised to the required minimum, after this probationary period, he/she will not be eligible to receive any Conservatory Scholarship funds for the following semester. (See Academic Regulations section in catalog.) Scholarship recipients are required to participate in ensembles as assigned. \tScholarship retention depends on the successful fulfillment of all obligations to the Conservatory, including orchestra, ensemble assignments, required GPA and satisfactory academic progress. No separate auditions are held for scholarships. For new students, the entrance audition serves as the basis for determining scholarship eligibility. For continuing students, annual juries and the quality of orchestra and/or ensemble participation are used to determine eligibility for continuation of awards. Scholarship retention for students returning after a leave of absence is not guaranteed. Students who wish to be considered for their previous scholarship amount must reapply through the Financial Aid Office, just as they would be required to do as continuing students. \tU.S. citizens or permanent residents who wish only to be considered for merit-based Conservatory scholarships need not submit the FAFSA, but must submit the Conservatory's Scholarship and Financial Aid Application.? \tThe following are links to several educational funders.

Key of Excellence Awards The American Scholar About the Society The annual Mary Isabel Sibley Fellowship is awarded alternately in the fields of Greek and French. The award may be used for the study of Greek language, literature, history, or archaeology, or the study of French language or literature. For 2014, the Sibley Fellowship is for the study of French language or literature. Candidates must be unmarried women 25?to 35 years of age who have demonstrated their ability to carry on original research. They must hold a doctorate or have fulfilled all the requirements for a doctorate except the dissertation, and they must be planning to devote full-time work to research during the fellowship year. The award is not restricted to members of Phi Beta Kappa or to U.S. citizens. The fellowship carries a stipend of $20,000. The stipend will be paid in two installments, the first on July 1 of the award year and the second on the next January 1, unless the Fellowship Committee orders the stipend withheld because the fellow has disregarded the purpose of the award as stated by the donor. In 1934, Miss Isabelle Stone left to the Phi Beta Kappa Society a bequest to establish a fellowship for women scholars. The conditions of the fellowship were established by this bequest. Miss Stone was a Durant scholar at Wellesley College. After election to Phi Beta Kappa and graduation in 1905, she went to Cornell University for graduate work and received a Ph.D. degree in 1908. She was then awarded the Alice Freeman Palmer Fellowship and spent the next year in Europe, principally in Greece, where she continued her study of Greek history and language. She spent the following year teaching in the American South, but was obliged to resign her position because of her father's illness. Through the Mary Isabel Sibley Fellowship?? named in honor of her mother ??Miss Stone passed on to other generations of women the pleasure and rewards she herself found during her year of study in Greece. The application deadline for the 2014 Sibley Fellowship in French Studies is January 15, 2014.

In 1979 the U.S. Department of Education designated CLAS as a comprehensive National Resource Center (NRC) on Latin America?a distinction it has retained continuously to the present.  CLAS' programs cover the entire Latin American and Caribbean region.  Two academic programs are especially noteworthy: The Latin American Archaeology Program, housed in the Department of Anthropology, involves research, training, and publications and emphasizes collaboration between North American and Latin American archaeologists. Fellowships and a bilingual publication series (funded by the Howard Heinz Endowment and The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation) further enhance this exceptional program. The Latin American Social and Public Policy Program draws on the impressive array of faculty and student expertise on Latin American policy issues available at the University of Pittsburgh. The program brings together researchers from different fields with the goal of contributing information of relevance to policy decisions facing Latin America. Social and Public Policy Fellowships are annually awarded to scholars interested in studying various dimensions of social policy at the University of Pittsburgh. The Latin American Social and Public Policy Graduate Certificate is available to students in this more specialized program. Latin American Library Collection Latin American Library Collection One of the major resources on Latin America available to students at the University of Pittsburgh is the Eduardo Lozano Latin American Library Collection. Its resources include exceptional collections on Bolivia and Cuba as well as extensive holdings on Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru, and Venezuela. Admission to the Center for Latin American Studies Admission to the Center for Latin American Studies Applications to the Center for Latin American Studies may be submitted either at the same time as applications to the University or after the student has been admitted. In either case, the center cannot accept students until they have received notification of admission to the University. Requirements for Certificates CLAS offers two graduate certificates: the Certificate in Latin American Studies and the Certificate in Latin American Social and Public Policy. Requirements for each are detailed below. Graduate Certificate in Latin American Studies To fulfill the requirements for this certificate, students must complete six Latin American area studies courses: two courses in the student's major department or school and four courses in at least two departments/schools other than that in which the student is receiving the advanced degree. The courses should total 18 credits. In addition, students are required to be proficient in a language of the area and to submit a research paper as detailed below. Graduate Certificate in Latin American Social and Public Policy To fulfill the requirements for this certificate, students must complete six courses focusing on social and public policy issues of Latin America: three courses should be in the student's major department or school and three courses should be in at least two departments/schools other than that in which the student is receiving the advanced degree. The courses should total 18 credits. In addition, students are required to be proficient in a language in their area and to present a research paper as detailed below. The certificates in CLAS require three years, or the equivalent, of college-level Spanish, Portuguese, or an Amerindian language of the area. Students must have adequate proficiency to converse and conduct research in Latin America. A standardized examination is given to each candidate by a faculty member of the Department of Hispanic Languages and Literatures.

If you would like to gain  research work experience that complements your studies in an academic setting,  these awards can provide you with financial support through your host  university. NSERC encourages qualified Aboriginal students to apply for this award.  Are you eligible for an award?  Who is not eligible?  Value of awards  NSERC will not reimburse the university for any period during which you worked part time. No payment will be approved for any vacation leave you take during tenure of the award.  Duration of awards  Where can you hold your award?  You must work under the supervision of a  faculty member who holds an active NSERC research grant (e.g., Discovery,  CREATE, Strategic, Research Partnerships), either at the time you submit the  application or when you hold the award. Faculty members whose research grants terminated on March 31, 2012, but who received an extension to use up the remaining funds from April 1, 2012 to March 31, 2013, will be eligible to supervise a USRA student in the summer or fall of 2013 or the winter of 2014. In addition, faculty members whose research grants terminated on March 31, 2013, but who received an extension to use up the remaining funds from April 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014, will be eligible to supervise a USRA student in the summer or fall of 2014, or the winter of 2015. Please consult the USRA Liaison Officer of the university at which you would like to hold the award to find out about eligible supervisors.  Applicants requesting an exception must pursue a research program with  the intention of obtaining NSERC research funding in the near future. Ongoing  collaborations, particularly with NSERC-funded faculty at the same institution  or elsewhere, recent refereed publications, a consistent supervisory record, and  recent applications for funding from sources other than NSERC are all evidence  of this intention.  Grants & Scholarships Expenditures by University/College To apply for these awards,  you must complete and  submit your application using NSERC?s On-line System. Refer to the instructions for completing Form 202.   You can apply to more than one university. You must apply directly to the university where you would like to hold the award. However, please note that it is the university's choice whether to accept candidates from other institutions.  How are students selected for awards?  NSERC allocates a quota of awards to each  eligible university and delegates the selection process to the university. All  application and review processes are internal to the institution. It is the  university's responsibility to establish its own selection criteria within the  broad guidelines that NSERC provides, and it may choose to apply stricter  criteria. When selecting students for awards, the university will assess the merit  of each application on the basis of the student's academic record and research  aptitude. In doing this, it will take into account the objectives of the USRA.  For university selection procedures and criteria, refer to the USRA Liaison Officer at the university where you would like to hold the award.  Each eligible university sets its own deadline dates for receiving applications. For information about these dates, contact the university(ies) to which you are applying.  Although awards may be held in either the summer, fall or winter term, each university will determine the number of selection processes it holds each year.  Each university will inform applicants of its award decisions after it has completed its selection process. To find out if you have received an award, contact the USRA Liaison Officer at your university.  Payment of awards  You will receive your payment from the university. The university will issue payments to you for the total value of the award in accordance with its pay procedures. It will also issue a T4 or T4A slip (Statement of Income) to you at the end of the calendar year.  NSERC  will pay its contribution directly to the university.  You may qualify for a travel allowance for the actual costs you incur to get to your host university if it is different from the one you are attending at the time of the award. The allowance is based on the economy airfare between the cities where the universities are located. Please note that travel allowances are taxable.  To request a travel allowance, apply to your host university upon arrival.  ^ Top of Page ^", "id": 99966}, {"text": "Association for Women in Architecture + Design Association for Women in Architecture + Design Dedicated to advancing and supporting the positions of women in architecture and allied fields.

Nancy Setzer Murray, the youngest of seven children of Jacob Eli and Sara Jane Setzer, was born January 9, 1916, in Newton, North Carolina; she graduated from Newton (N.C.) High School. Nancy also was a graduate of Catawba Business College and worked for Clyde Mills, Inc. in Newton from 1936-1941. She and Grover E. Murray were married June 21, 1941 in Columbia, South Carolina. They had two daughters ? Martha and Barbara Elizabeth. Dr. and Mrs. Murray traveled the world together, and she visited all the earth?s continents except Australia and all the United States except Iowa. Nancy Murray lent her support to a wide variety of endeavors while her husband was employed as a professor of geology and as an administrator by Louisiana State University (Baton Rouge) and Texas Tech University (Lubbock), including Achievement Rewards for College Scientists (ARCS), the Women?s Division of the Chamber of Commerce, the Women?s Council of the West Texas Museum Association, Ruth Circle of the First United Methodist Church, the Symphony Guild, the Ranching Heritage Association, the volunteer services of both Methodist and University Medical Center hospitals, the Women?s Guild of First Methodist Church, the Texas Tech University Women?s Club and the Quarterly Club. In recognition of her contribution to these activities, Nancy Setzer Murray was elected an honorary member of Mortar Board, the leadership honor society. As a living tribute, her family established at Texas Tech University the Nancy Setzer Murray Mortar Board Memorial Scholarship which later was converted to the Nancy Setzer Murray Memorial Presidential Scholarship. In addition to his academic and industrial work, Mrs. Murray?s husband, Grover, participated widely in professional society activities. Naturally, Nancy was deeply involved and to this date is unique in being Queen and Royal Consort to his highness ? Petros Rex II ? at the Krewe of Petros Ball held in conjunction with the AAPG/SEPM annual convention in New Orleans in 1965. As no successor ever appeared, she carried the designation of ?Queen? until her death in 1985. In December 1965, the Regents of Texas Technological College (now Texas Tech University) contacted the Murrays regarding the Presidency of that Institution. They accepted the offer in early 1966 and moved to Lubbock in August of that year. When Dr. Murray assumed the presidency on September 1, 1966, Nancy Setzer Murray became the First Lady of the University. For the next 10 years she carried that mantle and handled its varied demands and responsibilities with dignity and graciousness. She was, indeed, the ?Queen? of the University from 1966-1976. The two Murray daughters, subjected much of their youthful lives to geological trips and related activities, succumbed at least partially to the lures of the profession. Martha married C. Wylie Poag, now a prominent biostratigrapher, while he was a graduate student in the School of Geology at LSU. They now reside in East Falmouth, Massachusetts, where Wylie is a geologist with the U.S.G.S. They have three children ? Tracy, Marla and Graham Murray Poag (named after Graham B. Moody and grandfather Grover E. Murray, both former presidents of AAPG). Barbara was so ?enamored? by her father?s study of the earth that she took up study of another kind of body ? that of humans. She is Professor of Internal Medicine at the University of Texas Health Sciences Center in Houston, Texas ? known internationally for her work in infectious and contagious diseases. She is married to Ernesto Baca, a consulting environmental engineer. Funds to establish this grant have been provided by Nancy Setzer Murray?s daughters ? Barbara E. Murray, M.D. (Mrs. Ernesto Baca) and Martha Murray (Mrs. C. Wylie Poag); and by Sally Marie and Grover E. Murray.  The Nancy Setzer Murray Memorial Grant is awarded annually to a deserving graduate student for studies in which stratigraphy plays a significant role, through the American Association of Petroleum Geologists Grants-in-Aid program. It is endowed by the AAPG Foundation with generous contributions from her family and friends. Support the AAPG Foundation!

United States American students may apply for certain forms of grants and federal aid to assist with costs of college. For students who qualify, more information about specific forms of financial aid for qualified American students can be found on this page. The U.S. Department of Education?s federal financial aid programs are the largest source of student aid in America, providing nearly 70% of all student financial aid. Help is available to make education beyond high school financially possible. U.S. Department of Education Student Aid website National Science and Math Access to Retain Talent (SMART) Grant Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant Once you have determined if you qualify for any of the above listed federal grants, you may begin applying for Federal financial aid.? Federal financial aid comes in the form of student loans that you repay once you have completed your program or are no longer enrolled in college courses. Steps to receiving Federal financial aid Information that must be reviewed prior to consideration for financial aid: Private loans are available to students who do not qualify for other types of financial assistance or to defray educationally-related costs in excess of financial aid received from federal, state or other sources. Private loans are available to U.S. citizens, eligible non-citizens and also international students, at the discretion of the lender. Some lenders will approve loans only to credit-worthy U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens, while others will approve loans for international students provided they have a co-signer who is a credit-worthy U.S. citizen or an eligible non-citizen. Private loan programs are not affiliated with any federal financial assistance programs and are, therefore, generally more expensive. Approval of a private student loan application is based on creditworthiness, including debt-to-income ratio and credit history.

Fulbright-Harkness New Zealand Fellowship Fulbright New Zealand and the New Zealand Harkness Fellowships Trust invite applications for the Fulbright-Harkness New Zealand Fellowship, which offers the opportunity for an emerging New Zealand leader in any field of study or vocation other than health care* to study or research in the US for a minimum of six weeks. Successful grantees will receive NZ$15,000 (plus basic health and accident insurance) towards a short fellowship programme of their own design at any US university or institution. The Fulbright-Harkness New Zealand Fellowship aims to reinforce New Zealand-United States links by improving cross-fertilisation of ideas and experience between the two countries; to enable established or potential leaders and opinion formers in New Zealand to benefit from new ideas, practices and contacts in the US; and to increase Fellow?s abilities to bring about change and improvements in New Zealand. The two past Fulbright-Harkness New Zealand Fellows were Sacha McMeeking from Te R?nanga o Ng?i Tahu, who spent three months researching the role of indigenous leadership in corporate citizenship at Northwestern University?s prestigious Kellogg School of Management in Evanston, Illinois; and Glenda Anthony from Massey University, who spent six weeks researching reforms in teacher education at the University of Washington in Seattle. Last year?s Fellow, Glenda Anthony, described her exchange as a ?hugely thought-provoking and rewarding experience?. ?My Fulbright-Harkness experience provided opportunities to engage with a group of mathematics educators who are working at the cutting edge of innovation in teacher education. Working alongside researchers from the Learning In, From, and For Teaching Practice project, I experienced firsthand a range of instructional activities developed to support prospective teachers to do the work of mathematics teaching ambitiously, and observed beginning teachers across a range of university and school settings engage in ambitious mathematics teaching. Importantly, my time away provided the space to expand my horizons and think about exciting possibilities for developing new pedagogies for teacher education here in New Zealand.?

United States American students may apply for certain forms of grants and federal aid to assist with costs of college. For students who qualify, more information about specific forms of financial aid for qualified American students can be found on this page. The U.S. Department of Education?s federal financial aid programs are the largest source of student aid in America, providing nearly 70% of all student financial aid. Help is available to make education beyond high school financially possible. U.S. Department of Education Student Aid website National Science and Math Access to Retain Talent (SMART) Grant Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant Once you have determined if you qualify for any of the above listed federal grants, you may begin applying for Federal financial aid.? Federal financial aid comes in the form of student loans that you repay once you have completed your program or are no longer enrolled in college courses. Steps to receiving Federal financial aid Information that must be reviewed prior to consideration for financial aid: Private loans are available to students who do not qualify for other types of financial assistance or to defray educationally-related costs in excess of financial aid received from federal, state or other sources. Private loans are available to U.S. citizens, eligible non-citizens and also international students, at the discretion of the lender. Some lenders will approve loans only to credit-worthy U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens, while others will approve loans for international students provided they have a co-signer who is a credit-worthy U.S. citizen or an eligible non-citizen. Private loan programs are not affiliated with any federal financial assistance programs and are, therefore, generally more expensive. Approval of a private student loan application is based on creditworthiness, including debt-to-income ratio and credit history.

Although an important discretionary program, this  will be the first time in over 20 years that grants will not be available.  This decision has been taken by the AIATSIS Council  following considerable deliberation over recent times concerning the strategic  capacity of AIATSIS to undertake, support and commission research. In its  deliberations Council also discussed in considerable detail the changing and  increasingly competitive research and fiscal environment within which AIATSIS  operates. Council has noted the financial revenue growth over recent years of  both the higher education and research sectors generally which has not been  matched by the AIATSIS experience. Significant financial pressures are currently being  experienced by the Institute and this has been the case for some time. AIATSIS  funding from Government has fallen steadily over the past decade, in  inflation-adjusted terms. Well argued submissions to Government over a number  of past budgetry cycles seeking increased base funding, and/or exemption from  the efficiency dividend, have been unsuccessful. We have now passed the point  where all legislated functions, which relate to both our research and our  related archival collection responsibilities, can be delivered, and in this  context Council took the view that decisive action was called for.  Whilst Council noted, and appreciates, the Government?s  decision to exempt AIATSIS from the additional 2.5% efficiency dividend in  2012-13, this will have no positive impact on ongoing funding.  Internal reviews of the grants program presented to Council  workshops in 2010 and 2011 found that the program wasn?t meeting critical  intended purposes. Applications from Indigenous researchers and communities were  declining, community interest in more practical research did not necessarily  result in competitive applications, research costs were rising while the  overall pool of grant money was staying static, excellent grants of high cost  or major research collaborations could not be supported, and the costs of  managing the program relative to the amounts offered were higher than other  audited programs. Given the overall pressures on the organisation, AIATSIS was  struggling to maintain funding of the program at 7.5% of the total  appropriation whereas in the 1970s the figure was more like 24%.  At the same time AIATSIS had declining capacity to employ visiting  research staff, declining expertise in important topics, declining capacity to  provide research advice to government, declining capacity to support field  research of staff, increasing reliance on non-ongoing contract or grant based  research, and ad hoc support of Indigenous researchers. In addition, the grants  program is no longer eligible for inclusion in the Australian Competitive  Grants Register, due to a Government policy decision in 2010. For these reasons, Council reluctantly decided that the  grants program could not be funded next year. Instead, the funds will be used  to bolster research in priority areas which are critically short of resources. The  funding priorities will be: A report will be provided to Council?s meeting in August  2012 on the impact of this change and to consider the future.

Dana Russell was born in Pomona, California in 1906. He entered Pomona College in 1923. In his junior year, he took geology under A.O. Woodford and knew he had found his profession. In 1927 he entered graduate school at Berkeley. Dana mapped and described Pliocene sediments in the Sacramento Valley for his doctoral dissertation. He named and described a unit near the base of the sequence as the Nomlaki Tuff. He correctly interpreted it as a glowing avalanche deposit. He was among the first to recognize what later became known as welded tuffs. In 1931, he joined the geology department at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. He established his scientific reputation with studies of modern sediments of the Mississippi River. During these years, Dana conducted his pioneering studies of the mineralogy, size, roundness and shape of the modern sands of the Mississippi. In 1942, Dana joined the University of California Division of War Research in San Diego. After the war, the UCDWR shifted to what became the Navy Electronics Laboratory, and in 1947 Dana participated as a marine geologist in scientific resurvey of the atomic bomb test site on the Pacific island of Bikini. In 1955, Marathon Oil Company hired Dana to build a geologic research group. The emphasis during the Russell years was on organic geochemistry and on the interpretation of carbonate and detrital sediments. This research was for application to reservoir geology and enhanced oil recovery, as well as to exploration. In 1963, he was promoted to associate director for exploration research where he was responsible for geophysics and logging research, as well as geologic research. He remained in this position until his retirement in 1970. He was a strong and influential advocate of sedimentological research in both industry and in academia. In personal terms, the most important event of those years was his marriage in 1933 to Mary Flower Pugh of Bayou Lafourche, Louisiana. In 1977, Dana and Mary Flower moved to Santa Rosa, California, to be near their daughter, Nancy, and son, Rick, and their eight grandchildren.  The R. Dana Russell Memorial Grant is awarded annually to a deserving graduate student for research in petrology and petrography, or oceanography, through the American Association of Petroleum Geologists Grants-in-Aid program.

Solsem?s favorite experiences were the UN Fellows Program and the weekend activities offered by the Office of International Programs. ?It was a great experience and I want to come again!?

The program focuses on training in ecology, evolutionary biology, and conservation biology in tandem with the CBC's Network of Conservation Educators and Practitioners (NCEP), and aims to equip students with the practical and theoretical training they will need to address environmental problems in their home countries. All Graduate Student Fellows are advised by a Museum scientist, attend classes at the Museum in addition to those at their chosen university, conduct research, and participate in CBC projects. The program currently has four fellows, and nine Ph.D. students and four Masters students have completed their studies since the program's inception. The CBC's newest fellow is?Souvanny Ounmanny?from Lao PDR, who is pursuing a Masters in Conservation Biology at Columbia University. He has been a coordinator of NCEP activities in Lao PDR for several years, and plans to link his experience in community and professional education to the field of biodiversity conservation. He is also a recipient of the prestigious Christensen Conservation Leadership Scholarship, awarded by the Wildlife Conservation Society. Hugo Ernesto Escobar?, from Mexico, completed his first year of coursework at the Ph.D. program at the City University of New York (CUNY). Mr. Escobar also worked closely with Dr. Melanie Stiassny (Axelrod Research Curator at the Museum's Department of Ichthyology) to sort fish collected in the Lower Congo River in West-Central Africa during 2005 and 2006, and produced a new identification key for the genus Stomatorinus. Leo Douglas from Jamaica. Leo Ricardo Douglas?, from Jamaica, entered the Ph.D. program at Columbia in the fall of 2004 as a Fulbright Fellow. He just completed his third year, and among his academic activities were the successful completion of his first advanced examination and the development of his thesis research project on the biological and social impacts of Caribbean protected areas. He also took part in a collaborative international course on Ecosystem Services in Managed Landscapes and presented his team's results at a meeting of the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis held in California in May. Brazilian?Valeria Tavares?is pursuing her doctorate at CUNY, focusing on the phylogeny and biogeography of Neotropical bat families, a group known as \"short-faced bats.\" Her research interests also include the community ecology, functional morphology, and natural history of Brazilian bats. Chanda Bennett of the United States. Chanda Bennett?of the United States obtained her doctorate from Columbia University and joined the CBC as a post-doctoral fellow in spring 2007. Her work focuses on developing strategies for enhancing the recruitment and retention of individuals from historically underrepresented groups in the field of conservation biology, as well as developing urban ecology and education>programs. Bolivian?Nuria Bernal?graduated from the Master's program at Columbia in 2001. Ms. Bernal played an integral role in the initial implementation of NCEP in Bolivia, and in 2004 collaborated with the AMNH in the production of photographic exhibitions on biodiversity at two Bolivian natural history museums. Ms. Bernal is now working in Bolivia on CBC-supported community-based conservation projects, and on several Bolivian wildlife survey projects. Colombian?Liliana D?valos?obtained her Ph.D. at Columbia in 2004. Her research on bats has uncovered a systematic underestimation of species diversity in the Caribbean. After two years of post-doctoral research in genomics at the University of Arizona, Tucson, and at the AMNH, she recently joined the faculty at Stony Brook University, Long Island, New York. Carlos Iv?n Zambrana Flores?, from Bolivia, completed his Masters program at Columbia in 2005. His work focused mainly on predictive models of species distribution applied to amphibians. Mr. Zambrana has returned to Bolivia, where he is collaborating with NCEP activities and doing research on frog conservation. He teaches undergraduate and graduate courses as part of the faculty of the Universidad Mayor de San Andr?s in La Paz. After completing his doctorate at CUNY in 1999,?Abebe Getahun?returned to Ethiopia, where he is an assistant professor of biology at Addis Ababa University. His studies of the freshwater fish genus, Garra, provide important information for understanding and conserving freshwater biodiversity in Ethiopia and elsewhere in Africa. Le Duc Minh?, from Vietnam, completed the doctoral program at Columbia in the spring of 2006. His research centered on the systematics, biogeography, and conservation status of the turtle family Bataguridae in Southeast Vietnam. His award-winning book,?Vietnam: A Natural History?, co-authored with CBC Director Dr. Eleanor Sterling and CBC Scientist Dr. Martha Hurley, was published by Yale University Press last year. Dr. Le continues to carry out research at the Museum but will soon return to Vietnam to conduct conservation research, teach, and disseminate NCEP materials in several Vietnamese institutions. Peruvian?Victor Pacheco?obtained his doctorate at CUNY in 2003, for his research on the systematics of forest-dwelling Thomasomyine mice. Dr. Pacheco is associate professor and curator of mammals at the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos. Djunijanti Peggie?, from Indonesia, received her doctorate at Cornell University in 2001. Her research, on the systematics of the Indo-Australian butterfly sub-family Heliconiina, is important for recognizing the impact of changes to the endangered island habitats in which these butterflies live. She is now at the Indonesian Institute of Science's Zoological Museum in Bogor. Ana Luz Porzecanski?, from Uruguay, completed her Ph.D. at Columbia in 2003, where she carried out research on the systematics and historical biogeography of South American aridland birds, as well as on international environmental policy issues. She has since joined the CBC staff as the NCEP Coordinator for the Americas, and oversees training workshops and the production of NCEP modules in Bolivia, Mexico, Peru, and the United States.
